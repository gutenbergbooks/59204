  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The very miscellaneous nature of the contents of
this third and last volume of the present edition
of Crabbe’s <cite>Poems</cite> obliges me to trouble the reader with
a rather lengthy series of prefatory remarks. Before,
however, entering on these, I should like to supplement
what was said in the Preface to Vol. 1 with regard to
the source of the earliest among the <cite>Juvenilia</cite> there
printed. Since writing that Preface I have at last had
an opportunity of examining the whole set of Vols. <span class='fss'>I</span>-<span class='fss'>VI</span>
(for the years 1770–5) of the elusive <cite>Lady’s Magazine</cite>,
of which Vol. <span class='fss'>I</span> was published by Robinson and Roberts,
and the remaining five volumes by Robinson. Curiously
enough, the 1773 volume of this <cite>Magazine</cite> contains, in
the February number, a long piece of verse, apparently
a prize poem, entitled <cite>An Essay on Hope</cite>; but the six
lines quoted by the younger Crabbe are not to be found
in this poem any more than in that printed in the
October number of the 1772 volume of the <cite>Magazine</cite>.
By another coincidence, a poem called <cite>The Bee</cite>, signed
“Louisa Broughton,” appears in the April number of
the same <cite>Magazine</cite> for 1774. I may add, that the
June number of the same volume contains a poem, in
Shenstone’s manner, addressed “To Miss E——r M——,”
and signed “G. C., Cambridge, May 2, 1774.” It has
an apologetic introductory note, which <i>might have been</i>
written by Crabbe.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>To turn to the present volume. The <cite>Tales of the Hall</cite>
(Bks. <span class='fss'>XII</span>-<span class='fss'>XXII</span>), which occupy its earlier pages are, like
the previous <cite>Tales</cite> contained in Vol. <span class='fss'>II</span>, printed from the
edition of 1823; and the variants are taken from the
first edition (1819) and from the “Original MS.” readings
given as footnotes in the edition of 1834. The <cite>Posthumous
Tales</cite> are printed from Vol. <span class='fss'>VIII</span> of the <cite>Poetical
Works of Crabbe</cite> edited by his son (1834). The sources
of the variants in the <cite>Posthumous Tales</cite> will be indicated
immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the remaining contents of the
present volume, it may be convenient if I here, in
accordance with a promise made in the Preface to
Vol. <span class='fss'>II</span> of the present edition, furnish some account
of the Crabbe MSS. now in the possession of the
Cambridge University Press, as well as of certain other
collections of MSS. of which I have been fortunate
enough to be allowed to make use. In each case,
I have, for purposes of reference, indicated the marks
by which, in a list given at the end of the Bibliography
included in the present volume, the previously unpublished
pieces by Crabbe, here printed from transcripts
of the originals in the several collections, have been
distinguished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The MS. books acquired by the Cambridge University
Press (U.P.) are five in number. One of these,
half-bound in red, is throughout in Crabbe’s handwriting,
and contains, together with fragments of the
<cite>Posthumous Tales</cite> <span class='fss'>I</span>, <span class='fss'>III</span>, <span class='fss'>VI</span>, <span class='fss'>VII</span> and <span class='fss'>X</span>, and a version of
<cite>Lines written at Warwick</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_428'>428</a>), in each case offering
some variants which have been duly noted, <cite>Joseph’s Dream</cite>
(p. <a href='#Page_521'>521</a>) and some other pieces now printed for the
first time. The writing, partly in pen, partly in pencil,
on the first and the last four pages of this volume, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>been disregarded, as not sufficiently coherent to warrant
an attempt at printing it. A note superscribed “Duchess
of Rutland, Oct. 11th, 1824” (perhaps the lines in
question were written in the Duchess’s album) states
that the verses here entitled <cite>On a View of Barford</cite>
(p. <a href='#Page_505'>505</a>) refer to a picture drawn by Miss Bagot of
that house, when occupied by Mr and Mrs Mills. This
note further states that <cite>An Inscription at Guy’s Cliff</cite>
which Crabbe has marked as “By ——,” and the verses
added by him (p. <a href='#Page_504'>504</a>) refer to a picture of Guy’s Cliff
near Leamington, the property of Mr Bertie Greathead.
Another note explains that the verses <cite>On a Drawing of
Cadlands</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_518'>518</a>) refer to a picture of Mr Drummond’s
seat of that name by Lady Elizabeth Drummond; and
that the “drawing by the Hon. Mrs. Smith (Eliza
Forrester)” (p. <a href='#Page_519'>519</a>) consisted of “a Landscape and
other pieces.” This MS. book also contains an earlier
copy of the lines entitled <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Femme Jalouse</span></cite> (p. <a href='#Page_507'>507</a>).
The last three stanzas of the poem on a drawing of
<cite>Brompton Park Cottage</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_506'>506</a>) are added from the
version given in this MS. book. From it are also
taken a few readings in the stanzas <cite>For the Drawing of
the Lady in the Green Mantle</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_520'>520</a>). From it is also
printed the fragment <cite>Joseph and Charles</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_492'>492</a>), with
which should be compared Vol. <span class='fss'>VIII</span>, pp. 63 sq. of the
edition of 1834, and indeed the whole tale of <cite>The Family
of Love</cite>. It also contains a draft of <cite>The Equal Marriage</cite>
(<cite>Posthumous Tales</cite>, <span class='fss'>III</span>), with a few variants, noted among
those printed at the end of the present volume; also
a draft of <cite>Silford Hall</cite> (<cite>Posthumous Tales</cite>, <span class='fss'>I</span>), with
a considerable number of variants, of which the chief
have been noted in the same place. There are also to
be found here drafts of <cite>Lines written at Warwick</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_428'>428</a>),
and of the lines <cite>On a Drawing of the Elm Tree</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_431'>431</a>),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>&amp;c., there stated to be by Miss Chilibeen(?), both with
variants. Finally, the same MS. book contains the
lines which I have entitled <cite>Rest in the Lord</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_523'>523</a>) and
the unfinished lines <i>And He said unto her, “Thy Sins are
forgiven”</i> (p. <a href='#Page_524'>524</a>).</p>

<p class='c007'>On the fly-leaf of a second Crabbe MS. book in the
possession of the Cambridge University Press (U.P.)
is written: “This MS. is by the Poet Crabbe and in his
autograph. It is one of his Memorandum Books.”
This book begins with three pages of almost illegible
verse, which appear to contain an earlier draft of a
portion of what follows. Then ensues the long MS.
entitled <cite>Tracy</cite>, to which is prefixed, in Crabbe’s own
handwriting, the date “1 Jan. 1813,” and which is
interrupted at intervals by further illegible passages.
On pp. “18–19” of this MS. book there is an account,
only in part legible, of the beginning of the Lady’s
Vision, which is continued in the portion printed in the
present volume (from p. <a href='#Page_450'>450</a>). The lines beginning
“The good are happy,” appear to form no part of
<cite>Tracy</cite>, though they have been inserted in the middle of
it, and are therefore here printed as a separate piece,
to which I have given the title <cite>Conscious Guiltiness</cite>
(p. <a href='#Page_498'>498</a>). The verses superscribed <cite>Jane Adair</cite>, which
are similarly inserted in the text of <cite>Tracy</cite>, are likewise
printed separately (p. <a href='#Page_512'>512</a>), as are also those which I
have respectively called <cite>Horatio</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_513'>513</a>), <cite>Jacob and
Rachel</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_514'>514</a>), <cite>David and Saul</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_515'>515</a>), <cite>Belief and
Unbelief</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_499'>499</a>), and <cite>The Task</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_498'>498</a>). Then follows
a version of the lines <cite>On receiving from a Lady a
Present of a Ring</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_432'>432</a>); then a version of <cite>Villars</cite>
(<cite>Posthumous Tales</cite>, <span class='fss'>V</span>); then the fragment of a tale,
which I have entitled <cite>Susan and her Lovers</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_462'>462</a>),
interspersed with some illegible passages; then another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>fragment of a tale, <cite>Captain Godfrey</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_468'>468</a>); then a
further fragment, <cite>The Amours of G[eorge]</cite>, which is
obviously an early draft, in a different metre, of a large
portion of <cite>The Elder Brother</cite> (<cite>Tales of the Hall</cite>, Bk. <span class='fss'>VII</span>);
then the <cite>Charade</cite> (<cite>Modesty</cite>) (p. <a href='#Page_516'>516</a>); then a variant of
the conclusion of the tale of <cite>Villars</cite> (see above); then
the lines <cite>Tragic Tales, Why?</cite> a fragment (p. <a href='#Page_474'>474</a>).
Opening this volume at the other end, we find it
to contain prose-sketches of certain of the <cite>Tales</cite>; a
criticism of Gibbon and other miscellaneous matter;
besides the verses on <cite>Miss Waldron’s Birthday</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_502'>502</a>),
and some partially illegible and quite incoherent fragments.</p>

<p class='c007'>A third, small, MS. book (U.P.), of which the
writing is throughout remarkably clear, and which has
few variants from the text of the 1834 edition, contains,
together with fifteen of the <cite>Posthumous Tales</cite>, <cite>The Funeral
of the Squire</cite>, obviously designed as one of this series,
and now printed for the first time (p. <a href='#Page_489'>489</a>). There
is nothing in this book that has not been previously
printed except <cite>The Funeral</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fourth, small, MS. book (U.P.) contains, together
with some fragments of <cite>Tales of the Hall</cite>, Bks. <span class='fss'>VII</span>
and <span class='fss'>XI</span>, of which the variants have been noted in Vol. <span class='fss'>II</span>
of this edition, and a version of the lines <cite>On the Death
of Sir Samuel Romilly</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_439'>439</a>), the stanzas entitled
<cite>Matilda</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_516'>516</a>). A number of pages in pencil have
been unavoidably disregarded. In the same little book
are a few fragmentary lines, hitherto unprinted, that
must originally have been intended to form part of
the <cite>Tales of the Hall</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_473'>473</a>).</p>

<p class='c007'>A fifth, also small, MS. book (U.P.) contains,
besides a catalogue of Crabbe’s library at Trowbridge,
and a few accounts, the two short pieces printed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>in the present volume under the titles <cite>Momentary
Grief</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_507'>507</a>) and <cite>Enigma</cite> (<cite>Sovereign</cite>) (p. <a href='#Page_515'>515</a>). A
number of pages at the end of this volume have
been cut out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the kind offices of the Vice-Master of
Trinity College, Cambridge, Mr W. Aldis Wright,
I was allowed to examine a MS. volume in the Trinity
Library (T.C.) which bears the following inscription:
“This volume, which formerly belonged to Crabbe the
poet was given to the Library of Trinity College,
Cambridge, by Edward FitzGerald, M.A., April, 1871.”
The obverse of the volume contains a list of Plants,
beginning with <cite>Cryptogamia</cite>. On a fly-leaf are written,
in a tremulous hand (probably Crabbe’s), the lines
which I have entitled <cite>A Fragment</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_497'>497</a>). Then
follow, in Crabbe’s ordinary writing, the lines printed in
the present volume under the title of <cite>Poverty and Love</cite>
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ib.</span></i>); and towards the end of the book, are, in Crabbe’s
handwriting, the lines here called <cite>The Curate’s Progress</cite>
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ib.</span></i>). The reverse of this MS. book, which is on the
cover very neatly dated September 23, 1793, contains,
besides another shorter list of plants and much
miscellaneous matter, a scribbled page of verse, from
which I was only able to extract the following entire
couplet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Sum on Dress by this fair Creature spent</div>
      <div class='line'>Would more than equal Colin’s yearly rent.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Professor E. Dowden, LL.D., of Trinity College,
Dublin, has added to previous obligations conferred on
me in connexion with the present edition by allowing
me the use of two small books belonging to him, in
Crabbe’s handwriting (D.). One of these supplies the
complete Tale of <cite>The Deserted Family</cite>, now for the
first time printed (pp. <a href='#Page_477'>477</a>–488). The other contains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>drafts of <cite>Posthumous Tales</cite> <span class='fss'>VI</span>-<span class='fss'>XVI</span> and <span class='fss'>XXII</span>; the more
important variants offered by these are inserted in the
list at the end of the present volume. From this
MS. book are also taken the verses entitled <cite>The
Prodigal Going</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_517'>517</a>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The originals of certain pieces contained in the
present volume are to be found in a book belonging
to Mrs Mackay, of Trowbridge, which she has with
the utmost liberality placed at my service. This interesting
portion of Mrs Mackay’s collection (M.)
contains a series of proof-engravings of Corbould’s,
Westall’s and other illustrations of certain among the
earlier editions of Crabbe’s <cite>Poems</cite>. It also includes
a draft of a portion of <cite>The Sisters</cite> (<cite>Tales of the Hall</cite>,
Bk. <span class='fss'>VIII</span>; see Vol. <span class='fss'>II</span>, and variants, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ib.</span></i>), and the lines
<cite>To Lady Jersey</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_435'>435</a>), in a version, of which the
variants have been duly noted. From this book are
taken the following poems: the stanzas called by me
<cite>The Flowers of the Spring</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_508'>508</a>), of which I have
ventured to transpose the last two, and the fragment
which I have named <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Belle Dame sans Merci</span></cite> (p. <a href='#Page_509'>509</a>).
Both pieces are here printed for the first time. Mrs
Mackay’s collection also contains, written on separate
leaves, the blank-verse lines entitled by me <cite>The Passionate
Pilgrim</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_496'>496</a>), which are subscribed “Crabbe,”
and of which the handwriting in several respects resembles
that in Crabbe’s autograph of <cite>Midnight</cite> (see
Vol. <span class='fss'>I</span>), though less flowing than this; the couplets
called by me <cite>Sorrow</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_496'>496</a>), which are not in the
handwriting of Crabbe; and, finally, the lines <cite>To the
Hon. Mrs Spencer</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_503'>503</a>), which are signed “Geo.
Crabbe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr Buxton-Forman has most generously allowed
me to print a series of pieces from his collection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>MSS. (B.F.). It includes the verses which are entirely
in Crabbe’s handwriting, as is perhaps the signature
appended, and which I have called <cite>Hopeless Love</cite>
(p. <a href='#Page_510'>510</a>); the fragment <cite>David Jones</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_476'>476</a>) of which
the text may be, the title is certainly not, in Crabbe’s
hand; and the fragment which I have called <cite>Robert and
Catharine</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_475'>475</a>), as to which it seems uncertain
whether the text is in Crabbe’s hand. It is manifestly
an early draft of <cite>The Cousins</cite> (<cite>Posthumous Tales</cite>, <span class='fss'>XXI</span>);
but the actual phraseology in the two versions is very
rarely the same. The following pieces are also derived
from the same collection: those called by me <cite>Union</cite>
(p. <a href='#Page_511'>511</a>) and <cite>Revival</cite> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ib.</span></i>), of which latter the third
stanza appears in a rather different form on a separate
leaf; <cite>Metamorphosis</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_512'>512</a>); and <cite>Contentment</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_493'>493</a>),
a fragment of a tale. Mr Buxton-Forman’s Crabbe
MSS. also include memoranda for Tales and drafts
of parts of <cite>The Will</cite> (<cite>Posthumous Tales</cite>, <span class='fss'>XX</span>) and of
<cite>Belinda Waters</cite> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ib.</span></i> <span class='fss'>XV</span>). In neither case are the variants
offered by these drafts of importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, the late Duke of Rutland was so kind as to
allow several pieces of verse in Crabbe’s own handwriting
preserved at Belvoir to be transcribed for
insertion in the present edition (B). Some of these,
I cannot but think, were transcribed by the Duke’s own
hand. Most of them were exhibited at the Crabbe
Celebration held at Aldborough in September, 1905,
and successfully arranged and organised by Mr Charles
Ganz. The <cite>Verses to the Duke of Rutland</cite> dated Belvoir,
August, 1784, were most kindly transcribed for me
after the death of the late Duke by his Grace’s Chaplain
and Librarian, the Rev. F. W. Knox. Of these pieces,
the <cite>Verses written for the Duke of Rutland’s Birthday</cite>
(<cite>January 4, 1817</cite>) (p. <a href='#Page_499'>499</a>) and the lines entitled <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>Femme Jalouse</span></cite> (<cite>Teniers</cite>) (p. <a href='#Page_507'>507</a>) are here printed for
the first time; to the latter a few variants have been
furnished from an earlier copy in one of the MS. books
in the possession of the University Press (U.P.). The
stanzas For <i>the Drawing of the Lady in the Green Mantle</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_520'>520</a>), and <cite>Brompton Park Cottage</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_506'>506</a>), are also
printed for the first time, from transcripts made by the
late Duke of Rutland, or by his Grace’s instructions,
from the originals at Belvoir. In the former case the
original states the “Fair Artist” who drew the picture
to have been Miss Isabella Forrester. In the latter the
drawing in question is stated to have been made by
Lady Sophia Norman, the cottage having been lent to
the Duke, when ill, by Mr Greenwood. In the former
case the last three stanzas, and in the latter a few
various readings, have been supplied from one of the
Crabbe MS. books in the possession of the Cambridge
University Press (U.P.). To the lines <cite>From Belvoir
Castle</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_389'>389</a>), <cite>Storm and Calm</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_396'>396</a>), and <cite>To Sarah,
Countess of Jersey, on her Birthday</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_435'>435</a>), previously
printed in the 1834 edition, variants have been supplied
from the Duke’s transcripts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the <cite>Miscellaneous Verses previously printed</cite> reprinted
in the present volume the two <cite>Poetical Epistles</cite>
(April, 1780) are, by the kind permission of Mr Buxton-Forman,
owner of the MSS., and of Dr W. Robertson
Nicoll and Mr T. J. Wise, editors of <cite>Literary Anecdotes
of the Nineteenth Century</cite> (1896), and of Messrs Hodder
and Stoughton, reproduced at length from Vol. <span class='fss'>II</span> of
that work. Ten lines from the <cite>Epistle to Mira</cite> had
already been printed in Vol. <span class='fss'>I</span> (p. <a href='#Page_67'>67</a>) from the <cite>Life</cite>
(p. <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>) in Vol. <span class='fss'>I</span> of the 1834 edition.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this edition also come, with the exception of
the last but two and the last, all the remaining shorter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>pieces already published (some with variants, duly noted,
from the University Press and Belvoir MSS., from the
MSS. of Mrs Mackay, and from an article entitled
<cite>Treasure Trove</cite> contributed by Miss M. Jourdain to
<cite>The Book Monthly</cite> for May, 1906). This article, of
which Miss Jourdain and her publishers (Messrs
Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co.) kindly
allowed me to make use, consists of pieces printed from
transcripts made at Belvoir Castle. In Miss Jourdain’s
article is included stanza v of <cite>The Friend in Love</cite>
(p. <a href='#Page_437'>437</a>), which is missing in the stanzas given in the
<cite>Life</cite> (1834). A few variants in this version have been
duly noted. I may add that between <cite>The World of
Dreams</cite> and <cite>Sir Eustace Grey</cite> which in metre and
otherwise are so closely associated with one another, no
actual parallelisms either of sense or of form are noticeable.
The exceptions referred to are the following. <cite>The
Lines</cite> (<cite>Edinburgh, August 15, 1822</cite>) (p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>) are printed,
without variants, from a separately printed leaflet in
my possession: and the <cite>Lines addressed to the Dowager
Duchess of Rutland</cite> (p. <a href='#Page_441'>441</a>) from <cite>The Casket</cite> (1829),
with variants from Miss Jourdain’s article in <cite>The Book
Monthly</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Of the Poems hitherto unpublished</cite> a list giving the
source of each will be found at the close of the
Bibliography in this volume. In the general sequence
of these pieces I have so far as possible adopted a
chronological order; the whole body of previously
unpublished verse has however been divided into two
groups—viz. tales and fragments of tales, and lyrical
pieces; and, where there was no indication of date,
the poems taken from the same collection of MSS.
have been kept together.</p>

<p class='c007'>It remains for me to return my sincere thanks to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>the possessors of Crabbe MSS. already mentioned, and
to others who have in various ways aided me in making
this concluding volume of Crabbe’s <cite>Poems</cite>, and therewith
the edition as a whole, as complete as possible.
I should like, in especial, to thank Professor <span class='sc'>Morfill</span>
of Oxford for enriching the Bibliography at the close of
this volume by enabling us to refer to two works which
attest the very curious and significant fact of the
interest in Crabbe taken in Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Bibliography itself has been drawn up by
Mr <span class='sc'>A. T. Bartholomew</span>, of Peterhouse and the
University Library, who has again compiled the list
of Variants, and to whom the present volume of this
edition, like its predecessors, is throughout indebted for
his continuous cooperation. It is a true pleasure to
me to have been so zealously and efficiently aided
in the performance of my task by a member of my
own College.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>A</span>gain the Brothers saw their friend the priest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who shared the comforts he so much increased;</div>
      <div class='line'>Absent of late—and thus the squire address’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>With welcome smile, his ancient friend and guest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“What has detain’d thee? some parochial case?</div>
      <div class='line'>Some man’s desertion, or some maid’s disgrace?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or wert thou call’d, as parish priest, to give</div>
      <div class='line'>Name to a new-born thing that would not live,</div>
      <div class='line'>That its weak glance upon the world had thrown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And shrank in terror from the prospect shown?      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or hast thou heard some dying wretch deplore,</div>
      <div class='line'>That of his pleasures he could taste no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who wish’d thy aid his spirits to sustain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And drive away the fears that gave him pain?</div>
      <div class='line'>For priests are thought to have a patent charm</div>
      <div class='line'>To ease the dying sinner of alarm.</div>
      <div class='line'>Or was thy business of the carnal sort,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou wert gone a patron’s smile to court,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Croft or Cresswell would’st to Binning add,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or take, kind soul! whatever could be had?      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Once more I guess: th’ election now is near;</div>
      <div class='line'>My friend, perhaps, is sway’d, by hope or fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all a patriot’s wishes, forth to ride,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hunt for votes to prop the fav’rite side?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“More private duty call’d me hence, to pay</div>
      <div class='line'>My friends respect on a rejoicing day,”</div>
      <div class='line'>Replied the rector; “there is born a son,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Pride of an ancient race, who pray’d for one,</div>
      <div class='line'>And long desponded. Would you hear the tale—</div>
      <div class='line'>Ask, and ’tis granted—of Sir Owen Dale?”      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Grant,” said the Brothers, “for we humbly ask;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ours be the gratitude, and thine the task.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet dine we first; then to this tale of thine,</div>
      <div class='line'>As to thy sermon, seriously incline;</div>
      <div class='line'>In neither case our rector shall complain</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this recited, that composed, in vain.</div>
      <div class='line'>Something we heard of vengeance, who appall’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like an infernal spirit, him who call’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, ere he vanished, would perform his part,</div>
      <div class='line'>Inflicting tortures on the wounded heart.      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of this but little from report we know;</div>
      <div class='line'>If you the progress of revenge can show,</div>
      <div class='line'>Give it, and all its horrors, if you please;</div>
      <div class='line'>We hear our neighbour’s sufferings much at ease.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Is it not so? For do not men delight—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>We call them men—our bruisers to excite,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And urge with bribing gold, and feed them for the fight?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Men beyond common strength, of giant size,</div>
      <div class='line'>And threat’ning terrors in each other’s eyes;</div>
      <div class='line'>When in their naked, native force display’d,      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Look answers look, affrighting and afraid;</div>
      <div class='line'>While skill, like spurs and feeding, gives the arm</div>
      <div class='line'>The wicked power to do the greater harm.</div>
      <div class='line'>Maim’d in the strife, the falling man sustains</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ insulting shout, that aggravates his pains—</div>
      <div class='line'>Man can bear this; and shall thy hearers heed</div>
      <div class='line'>A tale of human sufferings? Come! proceed.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus urged, the worthy rector thought it meet</div>
      <div class='line'>Some moral truth, as preface, to repeat;</div>
      <div class='line'>Reflection serious—common-place, ’tis true;      <span class='linenum'>60}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But he would act as he was wont to do,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And bring his morals in his neighbour’s view.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“O! how the passions, insolent and strong,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bear our weak minds their rapid course along;</div>
      <div class='line'>Make us the madness of their will obey;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then die, and leave us to our griefs a prey!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Sir Owen Dale his fortieth year had seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>With temper placid, and with mind serene;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rich, early married to an easy wife,</div>
      <div class='line'>They led in comfort a domestic life.      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He took of his affairs a prudent care,</div>
      <div class='line'>And was by early habit led to spare;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not as a miser, but in pure good taste,</div>
      <div class='line'>That scorn’d the idle wantonness of waste.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In fact, the lessons he from prudence took</div>
      <div class='line'>Were written in his mind, as in a book:</div>
      <div class='line'>There what to do he read, and what to shun;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all commanded was with promptness done;</div>
      <div class='line'>He seem’d without a passion to proceed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or one whose passions no correction need.      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet some believed those passions only slept,</div>
      <div class='line'>And were in bounds by early habits kept;</div>
      <div class='line'>Curb’d as they were by fetters worn so long,</div>
      <div class='line'>There were who judged them a rebellious throng.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To these he stood, not as a hero true,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who fought his foes, and in the combat slew,</div>
      <div class='line'>But one who all those foes, when sleeping, found,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, unresisted, at his pleasure bound.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>We thought—for I was one—that we espied</div>
      <div class='line'>Some indications strong of dormant pride:      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It was his wish in peace with all to live;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he could pardon, but could not forgive;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, there were times when stern defiance shook</div>
      <div class='line'>The moral man, and threaten’d in his look.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Should these fierce passions—so we reason’d—break</div>
      <div class='line'>Their long-worn chain, what ravage will they make!</div>
      <div class='line'>In vain will prudence then contend with pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>And reason vainly bid revenge subside;</div>
      <div class='line'>Anger will not to meek persuasion bend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor to the pleas of hope or fear attend;      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What curb shall, then, in their disorder’d race,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Check the wild passions? what the calm replace?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Virtue shall strive in vain; and has he help in grace?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>While yet the wife with pure discretion ruled,</div>
      <div class='line'>The man was guided, and the mind was school’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>But then that mind unaided ran to waste:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>He had some learning, but he wanted taste;</div>
      <div class='line'>Placid, not pleased—contented, not employ’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>He neither time improved, nor life enjoy’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That wife expired, and great the loss sustain’d,      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Though much distress he neither felt nor feign’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>He loved not warmly; but the sudden stroke</div>
      <div class='line'>Deeply and strongly on his habits broke.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He had no child to soothe him, and his farm,</div>
      <div class='line'>His sports, his speculations, lost their charm;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then would he read and travel, would frequent</div>
      <div class='line'>Life’s busy scenes; and forth Sir Owen went.</div>
      <div class='line'>The mind, that now was free, unfix’d, uncheck’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Read and observed with wonderful effect;</div>
      <div class='line'>And still, the more he gain’d, the more he long’d      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To pay that mind his negligence had wrong’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>He felt his pleasures rise as he improved;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, first enduring, then the labour loved.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But, by the light let in, Sir Owen found</div>
      <div class='line'>Some of those passions had their chain unbound;</div>
      <div class='line'>As from a trance they rose to act their part,</div>
      <div class='line'>And seize, as due to them, a feeling heart.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His very person now appear’d refined,</div>
      <div class='line'>And took some graces from th’ improving mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>He grew polite without a fix’d intent,      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And to the world a willing pupil went.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Restore him twenty years—restore him ten—</div>
      <div class='line'>And bright had been his earthly prospect then;</div>
      <div class='line'>But much refinement, when it late arrives,</div>
      <div class='line'>May be the grace, not comfort, of our lives.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now had Sir Owen feeling: things of late</div>
      <div class='line'>Indifferent he began to love or hate;</div>
      <div class='line'>What once could neither good nor ill impart</div>
      <div class='line'>Now pleased the senses, and now touch’d the heart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Prospects and pictures struck th’ awaken’d sight,      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And each new object gave a new delight.</div>
      <div class='line'>He, like th’ imperfect creature who had shaped</div>
      <div class='line'>A shroud to hide him, had at length escaped;</div>
      <div class='line'>Changed from his grub-like state, to crawl no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>But a wing’d being, pleased and form’d to soar.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now, said his friends, while thus his views improve,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>And his mind softens, what if he should love?</div>
      <div class='line'>True; life with him has yet serene appear’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore love in wisdom should be fear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Forty and five his years, and then to sigh      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For beauty’s favour!—Son of frailty, fly!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Alas! he loved; it was our fear, but ours,</div>
      <div class='line'>His friends’, alone. He doubted not his pow’rs</div>
      <div class='line'>To win the prize, or to repel the charm,</div>
      <div class='line'>To gain the battle, or escape the harm;</div>
      <div class='line'>For he had never yet resistance proved,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor fear’d that friends should say—“Alas! he loved.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Younger by twenty years, Camilla found</div>
      <div class='line'>Her face unrivall’d when she smiled or frown’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all approved; in manner, form, and air,      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Made to attract; gay, elegant, and fair.</div>
      <div class='line'>She had, in beauty’s aid, a fair pretence</div>
      <div class='line'>To cultivated, strong intelligence;</div>
      <div class='line'>For she a clear and ready mind had fed</div>
      <div class='line'>With wholesome food; unhurt by what she read.</div>
      <div class='line'>She loved to please; but, like her dangerous sex,</div>
      <div class='line'>To please the more whom she design’d to vex.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This heard Sir Owen, and he saw it true;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It promised pleasure, promised danger too;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But this he knew not then, or slighted if he knew.      <span class='linenum'>170}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet he delay’d, and would by trials prove</div>
      <div class='line'>That he was safe; would see the signs of love;</div>
      <div class='line'>Would not address her while a fear remain’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>But win his way, assured of what he gain’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This saw the lady, not displeased to find</div>
      <div class='line'>A man at once so cautious and so blind;</div>
      <div class='line'>She saw his hopes that she would kindly show</div>
      <div class='line'>Proofs of her passion—then she his should know:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“So, when my heart is bleeding in his sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>His love acknowledged will the pains requite;      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It is, when conquer’d, he the heart regards;</div>
      <div class='line'>Well, good Sir Owen! let us play our cards.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He spake her praise in terms that love affords,</div>
      <div class='line'>By words select, and looks surpassing words.</div>
      <div class='line'>Kindly she listen’d, and in turn essay’d</div>
      <div class='line'>To pay th’ applauses—and she amply paid,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>A beauty flattering!—beauteous flatterers feel</div>
      <div class='line'>The ill you cause, when thus in praise you deal;</div>
      <div class='line'>For surely he is more than man, or less,</div>
      <div class='line'>When praised by lips that he would die to press,      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And yet his senses undisturb’d can keep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can calmly reason, or can soundly sleep.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Not so Sir Owen; him Camilla praised,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lofty hopes and strong emotions raised;</div>
      <div class='line'>This had alone the strength of man subdued;</div>
      <div class='line'>But this enchantress various arts pursued.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Let others pray for music—others pray’d</div>
      <div class='line'>In vain; Sir Owen ask’d, and was obey’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Let others, walking, sue that arm to take—</div>
      <div class='line'>Unmoved she kept it for Sir Owen’s sake;      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Each small request she granted, and though small,</div>
      <div class='line'>He thought them pledges of her granting all.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And now the lover, casting doubt aside,</div>
      <div class='line'>Urged the fond suit that—could not be denied;</div>
      <div class='line'>Joy more than reverence moved him when he said;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Now banish all my fears, angelic maid!”</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as she paused for words, he gaily cried,</div>
      <div class='line'>“I must not, cannot, will not be denied.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ah! good Sir Owen, think not favours, such</div>
      <div class='line'>As artful maids allow, amount to much;      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The sweet, small, poison’d baits, that take the eye</div>
      <div class='line'>And win the soul of all who venture nigh.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Camilla listen’d, paused, and look’d surprise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fair witch! exulting in her witcheries!</div>
      <div class='line'>She turn’d aside her face, withdrew her hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And softly said, “Sir, let me understand.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Nay, my dear lady! what can words explain,</div>
      <div class='line'>If all my looks and actions plead in vain?</div>
      <div class='line'>I love”—She show’d a cool, respectful air;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he began to falter in his prayer,      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet urged her kindness—-Kindness she confess’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>It was esteem; she felt it, and express’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>For her dear father’s friend; and was it right</div>
      <div class='line'>That friend of his—she thought of hers—to slight?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This to the wond’ring lover strange and new,</div>
      <div class='line'>And false appear’d—he would not think it true.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Still he pursued the lovely prize, and still</div>
      <div class='line'>Heard the cold words, design’d his hopes to kill;</div>
      <div class='line'>He felt dismay’d, as he perceived success</div>
      <div class='line'>Had inverse ratio, more obtaining less;      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And still she grew more cool in her replies,</div>
      <div class='line'>And talk’d of age and improprieties.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then to his friends, although it hurt his pride,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And to the lady’s, he for aid applied;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who kindly woo’d for him, but strongly were denied.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>And now it was those fiercer passions rose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Urged by his love to murder his repose;</div>
      <div class='line'>Shame shook his soul to be deceived so long,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fierce revenge for such contemptuous wrong;</div>
      <div class='line'>Jealous he grew, and jealousy supplied      <span class='linenum'>240}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His mind with rage, unsooth’d, unsatisfied;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And grievous were the pangs of deeply wounded pride.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His generous soul had not the grief sustain’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had he not thought, “revenge may be obtain’d.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Camilla grieved, but grief was now too late;</div>
      <div class='line'>She hush’d her fears, and left th’ event to fate.—</div>
      <div class='line'>Four years elapsed, nor knew Sir Owen yet</div>
      <div class='line'>How to repay the meditated debt;</div>
      <div class='line'>The lovely foe was in her thirtieth year,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor saw the favourite of the heart appear;      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis sure, less sprightly the fair nymph became,</div>
      <div class='line'>And spoke of former levities with shame;</div>
      <div class='line'>But this, alas! was not in time confess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And vengeance waited in Sir Owen’s breast.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But now the time arrives—the maid must feel</div>
      <div class='line'>And grieve for wounds that she refused to heal.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sir Owen, childless, in his love had rear’d</div>
      <div class='line'>A sister’s son; and now the youth appear’d</div>
      <div class='line'>In all the pride of manhood, and, beside,</div>
      <div class='line'>With all a soldier’s spirit and his pride;      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Valiant and poor, with all that arms bestow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wants that captains in their quarters know;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet to his uncle’s generous heart was due</div>
      <div class='line'>The praise, that wants of any kind were few.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When he appear’d, Sir Owen felt a joy</div>
      <div class='line'>Unknown before, his vengeance bless’d the boy—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“To him I dare confide a cause so just;</div>
      <div class='line'>Love him she may—O! could I say, she must!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus fix’d, he more than usual kindness show’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor let the captain name the debt he owed;      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But when he spoke of gratitude, exclaim’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>“My dearest Morden! make me not ashamed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Each for a friend should do the best he can,</div>
      <div class='line'>The most obliged is the obliging man;</div>
      <div class='line'>But if you wish to give as well as take,</div>
      <div class='line'>You may a debtor of your uncle make.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Morden was earnest in his wish to know</div>
      <div class='line'>How he could best his grateful spirit show.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now the third dinner had their powers renew’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fruit and wine upon the table stood;      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The fire brought comfort, and the warmth it lent</div>
      <div class='line'>A cheerful spirit to the feelings sent;</div>
      <div class='line'>When thus the uncle—“Morden, I depend</div>
      <div class='line'>On you for aid—assist me as a friend:</div>
      <div class='line'>Full well I know that you would much forego,</div>
      <div class='line'>And much endure, to wreak me on my foe.</div>
      <div class='line'>Charles, I am wrong’d, insulted—nay, be still,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor look so fiercely—there are none to kill.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I loved a lady, somewhat late in life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps too late, and would have made a wife;      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, she consented; for consent I call</div>
      <div class='line'>The mark’d distinction that was seen of all,</div>
      <div class='line'>And long was seen; but when she knew my pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Saw my first wish her favour to obtain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ask her hand—no sooner was it ask’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than she the lovely Jezebel unmask’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>And by her haughty airs, and scornful pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>My peace was wounded—nay, my reason tried;</div>
      <div class='line'>I felt despised and fallen when we met,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she, O folly! looks too lovely yet;      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet love no longer in my bosom glows,</div>
      <div class='line'>But my heart warms at the revenge it owes.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“O! that I saw her with her soul on fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>Desperate from love, and sickening with desire;</div>
      <div class='line'>While all beheld her just, unpitied pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grown in neglect, and sharpen’d by disdain!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Let her be jealous of each maid she sees,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Striving by every fruitless art to please,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And when she fondly looks, let looks and fondness tease!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So, lost on passion’s never resting sea,      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Hopeless and helpless, let her think of me!</div>
      <div class='line'>Charles, thou art handsome, nor canst want the art</div>
      <div class='line'>To warm a cold or win a wanton heart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Be my avenger”——</div>
      <div class='line in22'>Charles, with smile, not vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor quite unmix’d with pity and disdain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sate mute in wonder; but he sate not long</div>
      <div class='line'>Without reflection:—“Was Sir Owen wrong?</div>
      <div class='line'>So must I think; for can I judge it right</div>
      <div class='line'>To treat a lovely lady with despite,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because she play’d too roughly with the love      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of a fond man whom she could not approve?</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet, to vex him for the love he bore</div>
      <div class='line'>Is cause enough for his revenge, and more.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But, thoughts, to council!—Do I wear a charm</div>
      <div class='line'>That will preserve my citadel from harm?</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the good knight, I have a heart that feels</div>
      <div class='line'>The wounds that beauty makes and kindness heals:</div>
      <div class='line'>Beauty she has, it seems, but is not kind—</div>
      <div class='line'>So found Sir Owen, and so I may find.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Yet why, O! heart of tinder, why afraid?      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Comes so much danger from so fair a maid?</div>
      <div class='line'>Wilt thou be made a voluntary prize</div>
      <div class='line'>To the fierce firing of two wicked eyes?</div>
      <div class='line'>Think her a foe, and on the danger rush,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor let thy kindred for a coward blush.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But how if this fair creature should incline</div>
      <div class='line'>To think too highly of this love of mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, taking all my counterfeit address</div>
      <div class='line'>For sterling passion, should the like profess?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Nay, this is folly; or, if I perceive      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Ought of the kind, I can but take my leave;</div>
      <div class='line'>And if the heart should feel a little sore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Contempt and anger will its ease restore.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Then, too, to his all-bounteous hand I owe</div>
      <div class='line'>All I possess, and almost all I know;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>And shall I for my friend no hazard run,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who seeks no more for all his love has done?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“’Tis but to meet and bow, to talk and smile,</div>
      <div class='line'>To act a part, and put on love awhile;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the good knight shall see, this trial made,      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That I have just his talents to persuade;</div>
      <div class='line'>For why the lady should her heart bestow      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>On me, or I of her enamour’d grow,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There’s none can reason give, there’s none can danger show.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>These were his rapid thoughts, and then he spoke.</div>
      <div class='line'>“I make a promise, and will not revoke;</div>
      <div class='line'>You are my judge in what is fit and right,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I obey you—bid me love or fight;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet had I rather, so the act could meet</div>
      <div class='line'>With your concurrence, not to play the cheat;      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In a fair cause”——“Charles, fighting for your king,</div>
      <div class='line'>Did you e’er judge the merits of the thing?</div>
      <div class='line'>Show me a monarch who has cause like mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet what soldier would his cause decline?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Poor Charles or saw not, or refused to see,</div>
      <div class='line'>How weak the reasoning of our hopes may be,</div>
      <div class='line'>And said—“Dear uncle, I my king obey’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And for his glory’s sake the soldier play’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Now a like duty shall your nephew rule,</div>
      <div class='line'>And for your vengeance I will play the fool.”      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>’Twas well; but ere they parted for repose,</div>
      <div class='line'>A solemn oath must the engagement close.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Swear to me, nephew, from the day you meet</div>
      <div class='line'>This cruel girl, there shall be no deceit;</div>
      <div class='line'>That by all means approved and used by man</div>
      <div class='line'>You win this dangerous woman, if you can;</div>
      <div class='line'>That, being won, you my commands obey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Leave her lamenting, and pursue your way;</div>
      <div class='line'>And that, as in my business, you will take</div>
      <div class='line'>My will as guide, and no resistance make:      <span class='linenum'>380&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Take now an oath—within the volume look,</div>
      <div class='line'>There is the Gospel—swear, and kiss the book.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“It cannot be,” thought Charles, “he cannot rest</div>
      <div class='line'>In this strange humour—it is all a jest,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>All but dissimulation—Well, sir, there;</div>
      <div class='line'>Now I have sworn as you would have me swear.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“’Tis well,” the uncle said in solemn tone;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Now send me vengeance, Fate, and groan for groan!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The time is come: the soldier now must meet</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ unconscious object of the sworn deceit.      <span class='linenum'>390&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They meet; each other’s looks the pair explore,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, such their fortune, wish’d to part no more.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Whether a man is thus disposed to break</div>
      <div class='line'>An evil compact he was forced to make,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or whether some contention in the breast</div>
      <div class='line'>Will not permit a feeling heart to rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or was it nature, who in every case</div>
      <div class='line'>Has made such mind subjected to such face:</div>
      <div class='line'>Whate’er the cause, no sooner met the pair</div>
      <div class='line'>Than both began to love, and one to feel despair.      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But the fair damsel saw with strong delight</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ impression made, and gloried in the sight.</div>
      <div class='line'>No chilling doubt alarm’d her tender breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>But she rejoiced in all his looks profess’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Long ere his words her lover’s hopes convey’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>They warm’d the bosom of the conscious maid;</div>
      <div class='line'>One spirit seem’d each nature to inspire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the two hearts were fix’d in one desire.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Now,” thought the courteous maid, “my father’s friend</div>
      <div class='line'>Will ready pardon to my fault extend;      <span class='linenum'>410&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He shall no longer lead that hermit’s life,</div>
      <div class='line'>But love his mistress in his nephew’s wife;</div>
      <div class='line'>My humble duty shall his anger kill,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And I who fled his love will meet his will,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Prevent his least desire, and every wish fulfil.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hail, happy power! that to the present lends</div>
      <div class='line'>Such views; not all on Fortune’s wheel depends:</div>
      <div class='line'>Hope, fair enchantress, drives each cloud away,</div>
      <div class='line'>And now enjoys the glad, but distant, day.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Still fears ensued; for love produces fear.—      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“To this dear maid can I indeed be dear?</div>
      <div class='line'>My fatal oath, alas! I now repent;</div>
      <div class='line'>Stern in his purpose, he will not relent;</div>
      <div class='line'>Would, ere that oath, I had Camilla seen!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>I had not then my honour’s victim been;</div>
      <div class='line'>I must be honest, yet I know not how,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis crime to break, and death to keep my vow.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sir Owen closely watch’d both maid and man,</div>
      <div class='line'>And saw with joy proceed his cruel plan;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then gave his praise—“She has it—has it deep      <span class='linenum'>430}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In her capricious heart—it murders sleep;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>You see the looks that grieve, you see the eyes that weep;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Now breathe again, dear youth, the kindling fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And let her feel what she could once inspire.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Alas! obedience was an easy task,</div>
      <div class='line'>So might he cherish what he meant to ask;</div>
      <div class='line'>He ventured soon, for Love prepared his way,</div>
      <div class='line'>He sought occasion, he forbad delay;</div>
      <div class='line'>In spite of vow foregone he taught the youth</div>
      <div class='line'>The looks of passion, and the words of truth;      <span class='linenum'>440&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In spite of woman’s caution, doubt, and fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>He bade her credit all she wish’d to hear;</div>
      <div class='line'>An honest passion ruled in either breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>And both believed the truth that both profess’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But now, ’mid all her new-born hopes, the eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Of fair Camilla saw through all disguise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Reserve, and apprehension—Charles, who now</div>
      <div class='line'>Grieved for his duty, and abhorr’d his vow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Told the full fact, and it endear’d him more;</div>
      <div class='line'>She felt her power, and pardon’d all he swore,      <span class='linenum'>450&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Since to his vow he could his wish prefer,</div>
      <div class='line'>And loved the man who gave his world for her.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>What must they do, and how their work begin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can they that temper to their wishes win?</div>
      <div class='line'>They tried, they fail’d; and all they did t’ assuage</div>
      <div class='line'>The tempest of his soul provoked his rage;</div>
      <div class='line'>The uncle met the youth with angry look,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cried, “Remember, sir, the oath you took;</div>
      <div class='line'>You have my pity, Charles, but nothing more,</div>
      <div class='line'>Death, and death only, shall her peace restore;      <span class='linenum'>460&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And am I dying?—I shall live to view</div>
      <div class='line'>The harlot’s sorrow, and enjoy it too.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“How! Words offend you? I have borne for years</div>
      <div class='line'>Unheeded anguish, shed derided tears,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Felt scorn in every look, endured the stare</div>
      <div class='line'>Of wondering fools, who never felt a care;</div>
      <div class='line'>On me all eyes were fix’d, and I the while</div>
      <div class='line'>Sustain’d the insult of a rival’s smile.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And shall I now—entangled thus my foe—</div>
      <div class='line'>My honest vengeance for a boy forego?      <span class='linenum'>470&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A boy forewarn’d, forearm’d? Shall this be borne,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I be cheated, Charles, and thou forsworn?</div>
      <div class='line'>Hope not, I say, for thou mayst change as well      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The sentence graven on the gates of hell—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Here bid adieu to hope—here hopeless beings dwell.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But does she love thee, Charles? I cannot live</div>
      <div class='line'>Dishonour’d, unrevenged—I may forgive,</div>
      <div class='line'>But to thy oath I bind thee; on thy soul</div>
      <div class='line'>Seek not my injured spirit to control;</div>
      <div class='line'>Seek not to soften; I am hard of heart,      <span class='linenum'>480}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Harden’d by insult:—leave her now, and part,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And let me know she grieves while I enjoy her smart.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Charles first in anger to the knight replied,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then felt the clog upon his soul, and sigh’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>To his obedience made his wishes stoop,</div>
      <div class='line'>And now admitted, now excluded hope;</div>
      <div class='line'>As lovers do, he saw a prospect fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then so dark, he sank into despair.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The uncle grieved; he even told the youth</div>
      <div class='line'>That he was sorry, and it seem’d a truth;      <span class='linenum'>490&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But, though it vex’d, it varied not his mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>He bound himself, and would his nephew bind.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I told him this, placed danger in his view,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bade him be certain, bound him to be true;</div>
      <div class='line'>And shall I now my purposes reject,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because my warnings were of no effect?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus felt Sir Owen as a man whose cause</div>

      <div class='line'>Than health, with competence, and peace, with love?      <span class='linenum'>520&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ellis would sometimes, thriving man! retire</div>
      <div class='line'>To the town inn, and quit the parlour fire;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he was ever kind where’er he went,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And trifling sums in his amusements spent;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He bought, he thought, for her—she should have been content.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Oft, when he cash received at Smithfield mart,</div>
      <div class='line'>At Cranbourn-alley he would leave a part;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if to town he follow’d what he sold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sure was his wife a present to behold.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Still, when his evenings at the inn were spent,      <span class='linenum'>530&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She mused at home in sullen discontent;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, sighing, yielded to a wish that some</div>
      <div class='line'>With social spirit to the farm would come.</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a farmer in the place, whose name,</div>
      <div class='line'>And skill in rural arts, was known to fame;</div>
      <div class='line'>He had a pupil, by his landlord sent,</div>
      <div class='line'>On terms that gave the parties much content:</div>
      <div class='line'>The youth those arts, and those alone, should learn;</div>
      <div class='line'>With aught beside his guide had no concern.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>He might to neighb’ring towns or distant ride,      <span class='linenum'>540&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And there amusements seek without a guide;</div>
      <div class='line'>With handsome prints his private room was graced,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His music there, and there his books were placed;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Men knew not if he farm’d, but they allow’d him taste.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Books, prints, and music, cease, at times, to charm,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sometimes men can neither ride nor farm;</div>
      <div class='line'>They look for kindred minds, and Cecil found,</div>
      <div class='line'>In Farmer Ellis, one inform’d and sound;</div>
      <div class='line'>But in his wife—I hate the fact I tell—</div>
      <div class='line'>A lovely being, who could please too well;      <span class='linenum'>550&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And he was one who never would deny</div>
      <div class='line'>Himself a pleasure, or indeed would try.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Early and well the wife of Ellis knew</div>
      <div class='line'>Where danger was, and trembled at the view;</div>
      <div class='line'>So evil spirits tremble, but are still</div>
      <div class='line'>Evil, and lose not the rebellious will.</div>
      <div class='line'>She sought not safety from the fancied crime,</div>
      <div class='line'>“And why retreat before the dangerous time?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oft came the student of the farm and read,</div>
      <div class='line'>And found his mind with more than reading fed:      <span class='linenum'>560&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>This Ellis seeing, left them, or he staid,</div>
      <div class='line'>As pleased him, not offended nor afraid:</div>
      <div class='line'>He came in spirits with his girls to play,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then ask excuse, and, laughing, walk away:</div>
      <div class='line'>When, as he entered, Cecil ceased to read,</div>
      <div class='line'>He would exclaim, “Proceed, my friend, proceed!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Or, sometimes weary, would to bed retire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fear and anger by his ease inspire.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“My conversation does he then despise?</div>
      <div class='line'>Leaves he this slighted face for other eyes?”      <span class='linenum'>570&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So said Alicia; and she dwelt so long</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon that thought, to leave her was to wrong.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Alas! the woman loved the soothing tongue,</div>
      <div class='line'>That yet pronounced her beautiful and young;</div>
      <div class='line'>The tongue that, seeming careless, ever praised;</div>
      <div class='line'>The eye that, roving, on her person gazed;</div>
      <div class='line'>The ready service, on the watch to please;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all such sweet, small courtesies as these.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Still there was virtue, but a rolling stone</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>On a hill’s brow is not more quickly gone;      <span class='linenum'>580&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The slightest motion—ceasing from our care—</div>
      <div class='line'>A moment’s absence—when we’re not aware—</div>
      <div class='line'>When down it rolls, and at the bottom lies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sunk, lost, degraded, never more to rise!</div>
      <div class='line'>Far off the glorious height from whence it fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>With all things base and infamous to dwell.</div>
      <div class='line'>Friendship with woman is a dangerous thing—</div>
      <div class='line'>Thence hopes avow’d and bold confessions spring;</div>
      <div class='line'>Frailties confess’d to other frailties lead,</div>
      <div class='line'>And new confessions new desires succeed;      <span class='linenum'>590&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, when the friends have thus their hearts disclosed,</div>
      <div class='line'>They find how little is to guilt opposed.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The foe’s attack will on the fort begin,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he is certain of a friend within.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When all was lost—or, in the lover’s sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>When all was won—the lady thought of flight.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“What! sink a slave?” she said, “and with deceit</div>
      <div class='line'>The rigid virtue of a husband meet?</div>
      <div class='line'>No! arm’d with death, I would his fury brave,</div>
      <div class='line'>And own the justice of the blow he gave!      <span class='linenum'>600&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But thus to see him easy, careless, cold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his confiding folly to behold;</div>
      <div class='line'>To feel incessant fears that he should read,</div>
      <div class='line'>In looks assumed, the cause whence they proceed,</div>
      <div class='line'>I cannot brook; nor will I here abide</div>
      <div class='line'>Till chance betrays the crime that shame would hide.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fly with me, Henry!” Henry sought in vain</div>
      <div class='line'>To soothe her terrors and her griefs restrain;</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw the lengths that women dared to go,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fear’d the husband both as friend and foe.      <span class='linenum'>610&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of farming weary—for the guilty mind</div>
      <div class='line'>Can no resource in guiltless studies find—</div>
      <div class='line'>Left to himself, his mother all unknown,</div>
      <div class='line'>His titled father, loth the boy to own,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had him to decent expectations bred,</div>
      <div class='line'>A favour’d offspring of a lawless bed;</div>
      <div class='line'>And would he censure one who should pursue</div>
      <div class='line'>The way he took? Alicia yet was new;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her passion pleased him; he agreed on flight;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>They fix’d the method, and they chose the night.      <span class='linenum'>620&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then, while the farmer read of public crimes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Collating coolly [Chronicle] and Times,</div>
      <div class='line'>The flight was taken by the guilty pair,</div>
      <div class='line'>That made one passage in the columns there.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The heart of Ellis bled; the comfort, pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hope and stay of his existence, died;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rage from the ruin of his peace arose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he would follow and destroy his foes;</div>
      <div class='line'>Would with wild haste the guilty pair pursue,</div>
      <div class='line'>And when he found—Good heaven? what would he do?      <span class='linenum'>630&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>That wretched woman he would wildly seize,</div>
      <div class='line'>And agonize her heart, his own to ease;</div>
      <div class='line'>That guilty man would grasp, and in her sight</div>
      <div class='line'>Insult his pangs, and her despair excite;</div>
      <div class='line'>Bring death in view, and then the stroke suspend,</div>
      <div class='line'>And draw out tortures till his life should end;</div>
      <div class='line'>O! it should stand recorded in all time,</div>
      <div class='line'>How they transgress’d, and he avenged the crime!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In this bad world should all his business cease,</div>
      <div class='line'>He would not seek—he would not taste of peace;      <span class='linenum'>640&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But wrath should live till vengeance had her due,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with his wrath his life should perish too.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His girls—not his—he would not be so weak—</div>
      <div class='line'>Child was a word he never more must speak!</div>
      <div class='line'>How did he know what villains had defiled</div>
      <div class='line'>His honest bed?—He spurn’d the name of child:</div>
      <div class='line'>Keep them he must; but he would coarsely hide</div>
      <div class='line'>Their forms, and nip the growth of woman’s pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>He would consume their flesh, abridge their food,</div>
      <div class='line'>And kill the mother-vices in their blood.      <span class='linenum'>650&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>He with the husband mourn’d Alicia’s fall;</div>

      <div class='line'>He saw his tenant by this passion moved,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shared in his wrath, and his revenge approved.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Years now unseen, he mourn’d this tenant’s fate,</div>

      <div class='line'>Of one who felt himself to worth allied.      <span class='linenum'>660&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Such were his notions—had been long, but now</div>
      <div class='line'>He wish’d to see if vengeance lived, and how;</div>
      <div class='line'>He doubted not a mind so strong must feel</div>
      <div class='line'>Most righteously, and righteous measures deal.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then would he go, and haply he might find</div>
      <div class='line'>Some new excitement for a weary mind;</div>

      <div class='line'>Where she was wont in happier days to sit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who paid with smiles his condescending wit.</div>

      <div class='line'>Where prints acquired in happier days were seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now struck by these, and carried to the past,</div>
      <div class='line'>A painful look on every object cast.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sir Owen saw his tenant’s troubled state,      <span class='linenum'>680&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>Years hateful now—ere I my victims found.</div>

      <div class='line'>Of a small garret—a precarious home;</div>
      <div class='line'>For that depended on the weekly pay,</div>

      <div class='line'>Of these, thus follow’d by relentless fate?      <span class='linenum'>720&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>All, too, in winter, when the icy air</div>

      <div class='line'>Still more my mind to its foundation shook.      <span class='linenum'>790&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At last he spoke:—‘Long since I would have died,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But could not leave her, though for death I sigh’d,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And tried the poison’d cup, and dropt it as I tried.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘She is a woman, and that famish’d thing</div>
      <div class='line'>Makes her to life, with all its evils, cling;</div>
      <div class='line'>Feed her, and let her breathe her last in peace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all my sufferings with your promise cease!’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Ghastly he smiled;—I knew not what I felt,</div>

      <div class='line'>How base, how low, how groveling they became.</div>
      <div class='line'>I could not speak my purpose, but my eyes</div>

      <div class='line'>And knowledge of that power which she would now recal.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But still the more that she to memory brought,</div>
      <div class='line'>The greater anguish in my mind was wrought;      <span class='linenum'>810&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The more she tried to bring the past in view,</div>
      <div class='line'>She greater horror on the present threw;</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>My blood, and vile and odious thoughts instill’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“This war within, these passions in their strife,</div>
      <div class='line'>If thus protracted, had exhausted life;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the strong view of these departed years</div>
      <div class='line'>Caused a full burst of salutary tears;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as I wept at large, and thought alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>I felt my reason re-ascend her throne.”      <span class='linenum'>820&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“My friend!” Sir Owen answer’d, “what became</div>
      <div class='line'>Of your just anger?—when you saw their shame,</div>
      <div class='line'>It was your triumph, and you should have shown</div>
      <div class='line'>Strength, if not joy—their sufferings were their own.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Alas, for them! their own in very deed!</div>
      <div class='line'>And they of mercy had the greater need;</div>
      <div class='line'>Their own by purchase, for their frailty paid—</div>
      <div class='line'>And wanted heaven’s own justice human aid?</div>
      <div class='line'>And seeing this, could I beseech my God</div>
      <div class='line'>For deeper misery, and a heavier rod?”      <span class='linenum'>830&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But could you help them?”—“Think, Sir Owen, how</div>
      <div class='line'>I saw them then—methinks I see them now!</div>
      <div class='line'>She had not food, nor aught a mother needs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who for another life and dearer feeds.</div>
      <div class='line'>I saw her speechless; on her wither’d breast</div>
      <div class='line'>The wither’d child extended, but not prest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who sought, with moving lip and feeble cry,</div>
      <div class='line'>Vain instinct! for the fount without supply.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Sure it was all a grievous, odious scene,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Where all was dismal, melancholy, mean,      <span class='linenum'>840}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Foul with compell’d neglect, unwholesome, and unclean;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That arm—that eye—the cold, the sunken cheek—</div>
      <div class='line'>Spoke all, Sir Owen—fiercely miseries speak!”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And you relieved?”—</div>
      <div class='line in24'>“If hell’s seducing crew</div>
      <div class='line'>Had seen that sight, they must have pitied too.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Revenge was thine—thou hadst the power, the right;</div>
      <div class='line'>To give it up was heaven’s own act to slight.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Tell me not, sir, of rights, and wrongs, or powers!</div>
      <div class='line'>I felt it written—Vengeance is not ours!”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Well, Ellis, well!—I find these female foes,      <span class='linenum'>850&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or good or ill, will murder our repose;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>And we, when Satan tempts them, take the cup,</div>
      <div class='line'>The fruit of their foul sin, and drink it up;</div>
      <div class='line'>But shall our pity all our claims remit,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we the sinners of their guilt acquit?”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And what, Sir Owen, will our vengeance do?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It follows us when we our foe pursue,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, as we strike the blow, it smites the smiters too.”—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“What didst thou, man?”—</div>
      <div class='line in28'>“I brought them to a cot</div>
      <div class='line'>Behind your larches—a sequester’d spot,      <span class='linenum'>860&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Where dwells the woman; I believe her mind</div>
      <div class='line'>Is now enlighten’d—I am sure, resign’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>She gave her infant, though with aching heart</div>
      <div class='line'>And faltering spirit, to be nursed apart.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And that vile scoundrel”——</div>
      <div class='line in26'>“Nay, his name restore,</div>
      <div class='line'>And call him Cecil,—for he is no more.</div>
      <div class='line'>When my vain help was offer’d, he was past</div>
      <div class='line'>All human aid, and shortly breathed his last;</div>
      <div class='line'>But his heart open’d, and he lived to see</div>
      <div class='line'>Guilt in himself, and find a friend in me.      <span class='linenum'>870&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Strange was their parting—parting on the day</div>

      <div class='line'>And taste of joy—He feebly cried, ‘Forgive!</div>
      <div class='line'>I have thy guilt, thou mine, but now adieu!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Tempters and tempted! what will thence ensue      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I know not, dare not think!’—He said, and he withdrew.”—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But, Ellis, tell me, didst thou thus desire</div>
      <div class='line'>To heap upon their heads those coals of fire?”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“If fire to melt, that feeling is confest,—      <span class='linenum'>880&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>If fire to shame, I let that question rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>But if aught more the sacred words imply,</div>
      <div class='line'>I know it not—no commentator I.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Then did you freely from your soul forgive?”—</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>T</span>hree weeks had past, and Richard rambles now</div>
      <div class='line'>Far as the dinners of the day allow;</div>
      <div class='line'>He rode to Farley Grange and Finley Mere,</div>
      <div class='line'>That house so ancient, and that lake so clear:</div>
      <div class='line'>He rode to Ripley through that river gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where in the shallow stream the loaches play,</div>
      <div class='line'>And stony fragments stay the winding stream,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gilded pebbles at the bottom gleam,</div>
      <div class='line'>Giving their yellow surface to the sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>And making proud the waters as they run.      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It is a lovely place, and at the side</div>
      <div class='line'>Rises a mountain-rock in rugged pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in that rock are shapes of shells, and forms</div>
      <div class='line'>Of creatures in old worlds, of nameless worms,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whole generations lived and died ere man,</div>
      <div class='line'>A worm of other class, to crawl began.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There is a town call’d Silford, where his steed</div>
      <div class='line'>Our traveller rested—He the while would feed</div>
      <div class='line'>His mind by walking to and fro, to meet,</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew not what adventure, in the street—      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A stranger there; but yet a window-view</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave him a face that he conceived he knew;</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw a tall, fair, lovely lady, dress’d</div>
      <div class='line'>As one whom taste and wealth had jointly bless’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>He gazed, but soon a footman at the door</div>
      <div class='line'>Thundering, alarm’d her, who was seen no more.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“This was the lady whom her lover bound</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>In solemn contract, and then proved unsound:</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this affair I have a clouded view,</div>
      <div class='line'>And should be glad to have it clear’d by you.”      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>So Richard spake, and instant George replied,</div>
      <div class='line'>I had the story from the injured side,</div>
      <div class='line'>But when resentment and regret were gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pity (shaded by contempt) came on.</div>
      <div class='line'>Frail was the hero of my tale, but still</div>
      <div class='line'>Was rather drawn by accident than will.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some without meaning into guilt advance,</div>
      <div class='line'>From want of guard, from vanity, from chance;</div>
      <div class='line'>Man’s weakness flies his more immediate pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>A little respite from his fears to gain,      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And takes the part that he would gladly fly,</div>
      <div class='line'>If he had strength and courage to deny.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But now my tale; and let the moral say,</div>
      <div class='line'>When hope can sleep, there’s danger in delay.</div>
      <div class='line'>Not that for rashness, Richard, I would plead,</div>
      <div class='line'>For unadvised alliance—No, indeed.</div>
      <div class='line'>Think ere the contract—but, contracted, stand</div>
      <div class='line'>No more debating, take the ready hand.</div>
      <div class='line'>When hearts are willing, and when fears subside,</div>
      <div class='line'>Trust not to time, but let the knot be tied;      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For when a lover has no more to do,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He thinks in leisure, what shall I pursue?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And then, who knows what objects come in view?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For when, assured, the man has nought to keep</div>
      <div class='line'>His wishes warm and active, then they sleep;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hopes die with fears; and then a man must lose</div>
      <div class='line'>All the gay visions, and delicious views,</div>
      <div class='line'>Once his mind’s wealth! He travels at his ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor horrors now nor fairy-beauty sees.</div>
      <div class='line'>When the kind goddess gives the wish’d assent,      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>No mortal business should the deed prevent;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the blest youth should legal sanction seek</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere yet the assenting blush has fled the cheek.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And—hear me, Richard—man has reptile-pride</div>
      <div class='line'>That often rises when his fears subside;</div>
      <div class='line'>When, like a trader feeling rich, he now</div>
      <div class='line'>Neglects his former smile, his humble bow,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>And, conscious of his hoarded wealth, assumes</div>
      <div class='line'>New airs, nor thinks how odious he becomes.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“There is a wandering, wavering train of thought      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That something seeks where nothing should be sought,</div>
      <div class='line'>And will a self-delighted spirit move</div>
      <div class='line'>To dare the danger of pernicious love.”</div>

      <div class='line in2'>First, be it granted all was duly said</div>
      <div class='line'>By the fond youth to the believing maid;</div>
      <div class='line'>Let us suppose with many a sigh there came</div>
      <div class='line'>The declaration of the deathless flame;—</div>
      <div class='line'>And so her answer—“She was happy then,</div>

      <div class='line'>And, with such comforts in her present state,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A wish to change it was to tempt her fate;</div>
      <div class='line'>That she would not; but yet she would confess      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With him, she thought, her hazard would be less;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nay more, she would esteem, she would regard express;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But, to be brief—if he could wait and see</div>
      <div class='line'>In a few years what his desires would be.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Henry for years read months, then weeks, nor found</div>
      <div class='line'>The lady thought his judgment was unsound;</div>
      <div class='line'>“For months read weeks,” she read it to his praise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And had some thoughts of changing it to <i>days</i>.      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>And here a short excursion let me make,</div>
      <div class='line'>A lover tried, I think, for lovers’ sake;</div>
      <div class='line'>And teach the meaning in a lady’s mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>When you can none in her expressions find.</div>
      <div class='line'>Words are design’d that meaning to convey;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But often <i>Yea</i> is hidden in a <i>Nay</i>!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, what the charmer wills, some gentle hints betray.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then, too, when ladies mean to yield at length,</div>
      <div class='line'>They match their reasons with the lover’s strength,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, kindly cautious, will no force employ      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But such as he can baffle or destroy.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As, when heroic lovers beauty woo’d,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>And were by magic’s mighty art withstood,</div>
      <div class='line'>The kind historian, for the dame afraid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave to the faithful knight the stronger aid.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A downright “<i>No!</i>” would make a man despair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or leave for kinder nymph the cruel fair;</div>
      <div class='line'>But “<i>No!</i> because I’m very happy now;</div>
      <div class='line'>Because I dread th’ irrevocable vow;</div>
      <div class='line'>Because I fear papa will not approve;      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Because I love not—No, I cannot love;</div>
      <div class='line'>Because you men of Cupid make a jest;</div>
      <div class='line'>Because——in short, a single life is best.”</div>
      <div class='line'>A “<i>No!</i>” when back’d by reasons of such force,</div>
      <div class='line'>Invites approach, and will recede of course.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ladies, like towns besieged, for honour’s sake,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will some defence or its appearance make;</div>
      <div class='line'>On first approach there’s much resistance made,</div>
      <div class='line'>And conscious weakness hides in bold parade;</div>
      <div class='line'>With lofty looks, and threat’nings stern and proud,      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Come, if you dare,” is said in language loud.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, if th’ attack be made with care and skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Come,” says the yielding party, “if you will;”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then each the other’s valiant acts approve,</div>
      <div class='line'>And twine their laurels in a wreath of love.—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>We now retrace our tale, and forward go,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus Henry rightly read Cecilia’s “No!”</div>
      <div class='line'>His prudent father, who had duly weigh’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And well approved the fortune of the maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not much resisted—just enough to show      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He knew his power, and would his son should know.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Harry, I will, while I your bargain make,</div>
      <div class='line'>That you a journey to our patron take.</div>
      <div class='line'>I know her guardian; care will not become</div>
      <div class='line'>A lad when courting; as you must be dumb,</div>
      <div class='line'>You may be absent; I for you will speak,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ask what you are not supposed to seek.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then came the parting hour—and what arise</div>
      <div class='line'>When lovers part! expressive looks and eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tender and tear-full—many a fond adieu,      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And many a call the sorrow to renew;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sighs such as lovers only can explain,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>And words that they might undertake in vain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Cecilia liked it not; she had, in truth,</div>
      <div class='line'>No mind to part with her enamour’d youth;</div>
      <div class='line'>But thought it foolish thus themselves to cheat,</div>
      <div class='line'>And part for nothing but again to meet.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now Henry’s father was a man whose heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Took with his interest a decided part;</div>
      <div class='line'>He [knew] his lordship, and was known for acts      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That I omit—they were acknowledged facts;</div>
      <div class='line'>An interest somewhere—I the place forget,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the good deed—no matter—’twas a debt.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thither must Henry, and in vain the maid</div>
      <div class='line'>Express’d dissent—the father was obey’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But, though the maid was by her fears assail’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her reason rose against them, and prevail’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fear saw him hunting, leaping, falling—led,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Maim’d and disfigured, groaning to his bed;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Saw him in perils, duels—dying—dead.      <span class='linenum'>160}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But Prudence answer’d, “Is not every maid</div>
      <div class='line'>With equal cause for him she loves afraid?”</div>
      <div class='line'>And from her guarded mind Cecilia threw</div>
      <div class='line'>The groundless terrors that will love pursue.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She had no doubts, and her reliance strong</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the honour that she would not wrong.</div>
      <div class='line'>Firm in herself, she doubted not the truth</div>
      <div class='line'>Of him, the chosen, the selected youth;</div>
      <div class='line'>Trust of herself a trust in him supplied;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And she believed him faithful, though untried;      <span class='linenum'>170}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>On her he might depend, in him she would confide.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>If some fond girl express’d a tender pain</div>
      <div class='line'>Lest some fair rival should allure her swain:</div>
      <div class='line'>To such she answer’d, with a look severe,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Can one you doubt be worthy of your fear?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>My lord was kind—a month had pass’d away,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And Henry stay’d—he sometimes named a day;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But still my lord was kind, and Henry still must stay.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His father’s words to him were words of fate—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Wait, ’tis your duty; ’tis my pleasure, wait!”      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>In all his walks, in hilly heath or wood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cecilia’s form the pensive youth pursued;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>In the gray morning, in the silent noon,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In the soft twilight, by the sober moon,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In those forsaken rooms, in that immense saloon;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And he, now fond of that seclusion grown,</div>
      <div class='line'>There reads her letters, and there writes his own.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Here none approach,” said he, “to interfere,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I can think of my Cecilia here!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But there did come—and how it came to pass      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who shall explain?—a mild and blue-eyed lass.—</div>
      <div class='line'>It was the work of accident, no doubt—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The cause unknown—we say, “as things fall out”—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The damsel enter’d there, in wand’ring round about.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At first she saw not Henry; and she ran,</div>
      <div class='line'>As from a ghost, when she beheld a man.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She was esteem’d a beauty through the hall,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so admitted, with consent of all;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, like a treasure, was her beauty kept</div>
      <div class='line'>From every guest who in the mansion slept;      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Whether as friends who join’d the noble pair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or those invited by the steward there.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She was the daughter of a priest, whose life</div>
      <div class='line'>Was brief and sad: he lost a darling wife,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Fanny then her father, who could save</div>
      <div class='line'>But a small portion; but his all he gave,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the fair orphan, to a sister’s care,</div>
      <div class='line'>And her good spouse; they were the ruling pair—</div>
      <div class='line'>Steward and steward’s lady—o’er a tribe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Each under each, whom I shall not describe.      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>This grave old couple, childless and alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would, by their care, for Fanny’s loss atone:</div>
      <div class='line'>She had been taught in schools of honest fame;</div>
      <div class='line'>And to the hall, as to a home, she came,</div>
      <div class='line'>My lord assenting; yet, as meet and right,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fanny was held from every hero’s sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who might in youthful error cast his eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>On one so gentle as a lawful prize,</div>
      <div class='line'>On border land, whom, as their right or prey,</div>
      <div class='line'>A youth from either side might bear away.      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Some handsome lover of th’ inferior class</div>
      <div class='line'>Might as a wife approve the lovely lass;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Or some invader from the class above,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who, more presuming, would his passion prove      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>By asking less—love only for his love.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>This much experienced aunt her fear express’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dread of old and young, of host and guest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Go not, my Fanny, in their way,” she cried;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“It is not right that virtue should be tried;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So, to be safe, be ever at my side.”      <span class='linenum'>230}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>She was not ever at that side; but still</div>
      <div class='line'>Observed her precepts, and obey’d her will.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But in the morning’s dawn and evening’s gloom</div>
      <div class='line'>She could not lock the damsel in her room;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Fanny thought, “I will ascend these stairs</div>
      <div class='line'>To see the chapel—there are none at prayers”;</div>
      <div class='line'>None, she believed, had yet to dress return’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>By whom a timid girl might be discern’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>In her slow motion, looking, as she glides,</div>
      <div class='line'>On pictures, busts, and what she met besides,      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And speaking softly to herself alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or singing low in melancholy tone;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus she rambled through the still domain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Room after room, again, and yet again.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But, to retrace our story, still we say,</div>
      <div class='line'>To this saloon the maiden took her way;</div>
      <div class='line'>Where she beheld our youth, and frighten’d ran,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so their friendship in her fear began.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But dare she thither once again advance,</div>
      <div class='line'>And still suppose the man will think it chance?      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, yet again; and what has chance to do</div>
      <div class='line'>With this?—I know not; doubtless Fanny knew.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now, of the meeting of a modest maid</div>
      <div class='line'>And sober youth why need we be afraid?</div>
      <div class='line'>And when a girl’s amusements are so few</div>
      <div class='line'>As Fanny’s were, what would you have her do?</div>
      <div class='line'>Reserved herself, a decent youth to find,</div>
      <div class='line'>And just be civil, sociable, and kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And look together at the setting sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then at each other—What the evil done?      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then Fanny took my little lord to play,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bade him not intrude on Henry’s way.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“O, he intrudes not!” said the youth, and grew</div>
      <div class='line'>Fond of the child, and would amuse him too;</div>
      <div class='line'>Would make such faces, and assume such looks—</div>
      <div class='line'>He loved it better than his gayest books.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When man with man would an acquaintance seek,</div>
      <div class='line'>He will his thoughts in chosen language speak;</div>
      <div class='line'>And they converse on divers themes, to find</div>
      <div class='line'>If they possess a corresponding mind;      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But man with woman has foundation laid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And built up friendship ere a word is said.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis not with words that they their wishes tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>But with a language answering quite as well;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus they find, when they begin t’explore</div>
      <div class='line'>Their way by speech, they knew it all before.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And now it chanced again the pair, when dark,</div>
      <div class='line'>Met in their way, when wandering in the park;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not in the common path, for so they might,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without a wonder, wander day or night;      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But, when in pathless ways their chance will bring</div>
      <div class='line'>A musing pair, we do admire the thing.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The youth in meeting read the damsel’s face,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if he meant her inmost thoughts to trace;</div>
      <div class='line'>On which her colour changed, as if she meant</div>
      <div class='line'>To give her aid, and help his kind intent.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Both smiled and parted, but they did not speak—</div>
      <div class='line'>The smile implied, “Do tell me what you seek.”</div>
      <div class='line'>They took their different ways with erring feet,</div>
      <div class='line'>And met again, surprised that they could meet;      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then must they speak—and something of the air</div>
      <div class='line'>Is always ready—“’Tis extremely fair!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“It was so pleasant!” Henry said; “the beam</div>
      <div class='line'>Of that sweet light so brilliant on the stream;</div>
      <div class='line'>And chiefly yonder, where that old cascade</div>
      <div class='line'>Has for an age its simple music made;</div>
      <div class='line'>All so delightful, soothing, and serene!</div>
      <div class='line'>Do you not feel it? not enjoy the scene?</div>
      <div class='line'>Something it has that words will not express,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But rather hide, and make th’ enjoyment less:      <span class='linenum'>300}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis what our souls conceive, ’tis what our hearts confess.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Poor Fanny’s heart at these same words confess’d</div>
      <div class='line'>How well he painted, and how rightly guess’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, while they stood admiring their retreat,</div>
      <div class='line'>Henry found something like a mossy seat;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Fanny sat not; no, she rather pray’d</div>
      <div class='line'>That she might leave him, she was so afraid—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Not, sir, of you; your goodness I can trust;</div>
      <div class='line'>But folks are so censorious and unjust,</div>
      <div class='line'>They make no difference, they pay no regard      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To our true meaning, which is very hard</div>
      <div class='line'>And very cruel; great the pain it cost</div>
      <div class='line'>To lose such pleasure, but it must be lost.</div>
      <div class='line'>Did people know how free from thought of ill</div>
      <div class='line'>One’s meaning is, their malice would be still.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At this she wept; at least a glittering gem</div>
      <div class='line'>Shone in each eye, and there was fire in them,</div>
      <div class='line'>For, as they fell, the sparkles, at his feet,</div>
      <div class='line'>He felt emotions very warm and sweet.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“A lovely creature! not more fair than good;      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>By all admired, by some, it seems, pursued;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet self-protected by her virtue’s force</div>
      <div class='line'>And conscious truth—What evil in discourse</div>
      <div class='line'>With one so guarded, who is pleased to trust</div>
      <div class='line'>Herself with me, reliance strong and just?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Our lover then believed he must not seem</div>
      <div class='line'>Cold to the maid who gave him her esteem;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not manly this; Cecilia had his heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>But it was lawful with his time to part.</div>
      <div class='line'>It would be wrong in her to take amiss      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A virtuous friendship for a girl like this;</div>
      <div class='line'>False or disloyal he would never prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>But kindness here took nothing from his love.</div>
      <div class='line'>Soldiers to serve a foreign prince are known,</div>
      <div class='line'>When not on present duty to their own;</div>
      <div class='line'>So, though our bosom’s queen we still prefer,</div>
      <div class='line'>We are not always on our knees to her.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Cecilia present, witness yon fair moon,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yon bright orbs, that fate would change as soon</div>
      <div class='line'>As my devotion; but the absent sun      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Cheers us no longer when his course is run;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>And then those starry twinklers may obtain</div>
      <div class='line'>A little worship till he shines again.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The father still commanded “Wait awhile;”</div>
      <div class='line'>And the son answer’d in submissive style,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grieved, but obedient; and obedience teased</div>
      <div class='line'>His lady’s spirit more than grieving pleased.</div>
      <div class='line'>That he should grieve in absence was most fit,</div>
      <div class='line'>But not that he to absence should submit;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in her letters might be traced reproof,      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Distant indeed, but visible enough;</div>
      <div class='line'>This should the wandering of his heart have stay’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! the wanderer was the vainer made.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The parties daily met, as by consent,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet it always seem’d by accident;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till in the nymph the shepherd had been blind</div>
      <div class='line'>If he had fail’d to see a manner kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>With that expressive look, that seem’d to say,</div>
      <div class='line'>“You do not speak, and yet you see you may.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>O! yes, he saw, and he resolved to fly,      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And blamed his heart, unwilling to comply:</div>
      <div class='line'>He sometimes wonder’d how it came to pass,</div>
      <div class='line'>That he had all this freedom with the lass;</div>
      <div class='line'>Reserved herself, with strict attention kept,</div>
      <div class='line'>And care and vigilance that never slept:</div>
      <div class='line'>“How is it thus that they a beauty trust</div>
      <div class='line'>With me, who feel the confidence is just?</div>
      <div class='line'>And they, too, feel it; yes, they may confide;”—</div>
      <div class='line'>He said in folly, and he smiled in pride.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>’Tis thus our secret passions work their way,      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And the poor victims know not they obey.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Familiar now became the wandering pair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there was pride and joy in Fanny’s air;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, though his silence did not please the maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>She judged him only modest and afraid.</div>
      <div class='line'>The gentle dames are ever pleased to find</div>
      <div class='line'>Their lovers dreading they should prove unkind;</div>
      <div class='line'>So, blind by hope, and pleased with prospects gay,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The generous beauty gave her heart away      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Before he said, “I love!”—alas! he dared not say.      <span class='linenum'>380}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Cecilia yet was mistress of his mind,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>But oft he wish’d her, like his Fanny, kind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her fondness sooth’d him, for the man was vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he perceived that he could give her pain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Cecilia liked not to profess her love,</div>
      <div class='line'>But Fanny ever was the yielding dove;</div>
      <div class='line'>Tender and trusting, waiting for the word,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then prepared to hail her bosom’s lord.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Cecilia once her honest love avow’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>To make him happy, not to make him proud;      <span class='linenum'>390&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But she would not, for every asking sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>Confess the flame that waked his vanity;</div>
      <div class='line'>But this poor maiden, every day and hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would, by fresh kindness, feed the growing power;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he indulged, vain being! in the joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>That he alone could raise it, or destroy;</div>
      <div class='line'>A present good, from which he dared not fly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cecilia absent, and his Fanny by.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>O! vain desire of youth, that in the hour</div>
      <div class='line'>Of strong temptation, when he feels the power,      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And knows how daily his desires increase,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet will he wait, and sacrifice his peace;</div>
      <div class='line'>Will trust to chance to free him from the snare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of which, long since, his conscience said, beware!</div>
      <div class='line'>Or look for strange deliverance from that ill,</div>
      <div class='line'>That he might fly, could he command the will!</div>
      <div class='line'>How can he freedom from the future seek,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who feels already that he grows too weak?</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus refuses to resist, till time</div>
      <div class='line'>Removes the power, and makes the way for crime.      <span class='linenum'>410&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet thoughts he had, and he would think, “Forego</div>
      <div class='line'>My dear Cecilia? not for kingdoms! No!</div>
      <div class='line'>But may I, ought I, not the friend to be</div>
      <div class='line'>Of one who feels this fond regard for me?</div>
      <div class='line'>I wrong no creature by a kindness lent</div>
      <div class='line'>To one so gentle, mild, and innocent;</div>
      <div class='line'>And for that fair one, whom I still adore,</div>
      <div class='line'>By feeling thus I think of her the more”—</div>
      <div class='line'>And not unlikely, for our thoughts will tend</div>
      <div class='line'>To those whom we are conscious we offend.      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Had Reason whisper’d, “Has Cecilia leave</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Some gentle youth in friendship to receive,</div>
      <div class='line'>And be to him the friend that you appear      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To this soft girl?”—would not some jealous fear      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Proclaim your thoughts, that he approach’d too near?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But Henry, blinded still, presumed to write</div>
      <div class='line'>Of one in whom Cecilia would delight:</div>
      <div class='line'>A mild and modest girl, a gentle friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>If, as he hoped, her kindness would descend—</div>
      <div class='line'>But what he fear’d to lose or hoped to gain      <span class='linenum'>430&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>By writing thus, he had been ask’d in vain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It was his purpose, every morn he rose,</div>
      <div class='line'>The dangerous friendship he had made to close;</div>
      <div class='line'>It was his torment nightly, ere he slept,</div>
      <div class='line'>To feel his prudent purpose was not kept.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>True, he has wonder’d why the timid maid</div>
      <div class='line'>Meets him so often, and is not afraid;</div>
      <div class='line'>And why that female dragon, fierce and keen,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Has never in their private walks been seen;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And often he has thought, “What can their silence mean?      <span class='linenum'>440}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“They can have no design, or plot, or plan,—</div>
      <div class='line'>In fact, I know not how the thing began,—</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis their dependence on my credit here,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fear not, nor, in fact, have cause to fear.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But did that pair, who seem’d to think that all</div>
      <div class='line'>Unwatch’d will wander and unguarded fall,</div>
      <div class='line'>Did they permit a youth and maid to meet</div>
      <div class='line'>Both unreproved? were they so indiscreet?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This sometimes enter’d Henry’s mind, and then,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Who shall account for women or for men?”      <span class='linenum'>450&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He said; “or who their secret thoughts explore?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why do I vex me? I will think no more.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>My lord of late had said, in manner kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>“My good friend Harry, do not think us blind!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Letters had past, though he had nothing seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>His careful father and my lord between;</div>
      <div class='line'>But to what purpose was to him unknown—</div>
      <div class='line'>It might be borough business, or their own.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Fanny, it seem’d, was now no more in dread;</div>
      <div class='line'>If one approach’d, she neither fear’d nor fled.      <span class='linenum'>460&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He mused on this—“But wherefore her alarm?</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>She knows me better, and she dreads no harm.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Something his father wrote that gave him pain:</div>
      <div class='line'>“I know not, son, if you should yet remain;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Be cautious, Harry; favours to procure</div>
      <div class='line'>We strain a point, but we must first be sure.</div>
      <div class='line'>Love is a folly—that, indeed, is true—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But something still is to our honour due;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So I must leave the thing to my good lord and you.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But from Cecilia came remonstrance strong:      <span class='linenum'>470&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“You write too darkly, and you stay too long;</div>
      <div class='line'>We hear reports; and, Henry—mark me well—</div>
      <div class='line'>I heed not every tale that triflers tell;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Be you no trifler; dare not to believe</div>
      <div class='line'>That I am one whom words and vows deceive:</div>
      <div class='line'>You know your heart, your hazard you will learn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And this your trial——instantly return.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Unjust, injurious, jealous, cruel maid!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Am I a slave, of haughty words afraid?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Can she who thus commands expect to be obey’d?      <span class='linenum'>480}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>O! how unlike this dear assenting soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose heart a man might at his will control!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Uneasy, anxious, fill’d with self-reproof,</div>
      <div class='line'>He now resolved to quit his patron’s roof;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then again his vacillating mind</div>
      <div class='line'>To stay resolved, and that her pride should find.</div>
      <div class='line'>Debating thus, his pen the lover took,</div>
      <div class='line'>And chose the words of anger and rebuke.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Again, yet once again, the conscious pair</div>
      <div class='line'>Met, and “O, speak!” was Fanny’s silent prayer;      <span class='linenum'>490&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, “I must speak,” said the embarrass’d youth,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Must save my honour, must confess the truth.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, I must lose her; but, by slow degrees,</div>
      <div class='line'>She will regain her peace, and I my ease.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ah! foolish man! to virtue true nor vice,</div>
      <div class='line'>He buys distress, and self-esteem the price;</div>
      <div class='line'>And what his gain?—a tender smile and sigh</div>
      <div class='line'>From a fond girl to feed his vanity.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus, every day they lived, and every time</div>
      <div class='line'>They met, increased his anguish and his crime.      <span class='linenum'>500&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Still in their meetings they were ofttimes nigh</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The darling theme, and then past trembling by;</div>
      <div class='line'>On those occasions Henry often tried</div>
      <div class='line'>For the sad truth—and then his heart denied</div>
      <div class='line'>The utterance due: thus daily he became</div>
      <div class='line'>The prey of weakness, vanity, and shame.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But soon a day, that was their doubts to close,</div>
      <div class='line'>On the fond maid and thoughtless youth arose.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Within the park, beside the bounding brook,</div>
      <div class='line'>The social pair their usual ramble took;      <span class='linenum'>510&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And there the steward found them; they could trace</div>
      <div class='line'>News in his look, and gladness in his face.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He was a man of riches, bluff and big,</div>
      <div class='line'>With clean brown broad-cloth, and with white cut wig:</div>
      <div class='line'>He bore a cane of price, with riband tied,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a fat spaniel waddled at his side.</div>
      <div class='line'>To every being whom he met he gave</div>
      <div class='line'>His looks expressive: civil, gay, or grave,</div>
      <div class='line'>But condescending all; and each declared</div>
      <div class='line'>How much he govern’d, and how well he fared.      <span class='linenum'>520&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>This great man bow’d, not humbly, but his bow</div>
      <div class='line'>Appear’d familiar converse to allow.</div>
      <div class='line'>The trembling Fanny, as he came in view,</div>
      <div class='line'>Within the chestnut grove in fear withdrew;</div>
      <div class='line'>While Henry wonder’d, not without a fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of that which brought th’ important man so near.</div>
      <div class='line'>Doubt was dispersed by—“My esteem’d young man!”</div>
      <div class='line'>As he with condescending grace began——</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Though you with youthful frankness nobly trust</div>
      <div class='line'>Your Fanny’s friends, and doubtless think them just;      <span class='linenum'>530&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Though you have not, with craving soul, applied</div>
      <div class='line'>To us, and ask’d the fortune of your bride:</div>
      <div class='line'>Be it our care that you shall not lament</div>
      <div class='line'>That love has made you so improvident.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“An orphan maid——Your patience! you shall have</div>
      <div class='line'>Your time to speak, I now attention crave—</div>
      <div class='line'>Fanny, dear girl! has in my spouse and me</div>
      <div class='line'>Friends of a kind we wish our friends to be,</div>
      <div class='line'>None of the poorest——nay, sir, no reply;</div>
      <div class='line'>You shall not need——and we are born to die;      <span class='linenum'>540&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And one yet crawls on earth, of whom I say</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>That what he has he cannot take away—</div>
      <div class='line'>Her mother’s father, one who has a store</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this world’s good, and always looks for more;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, next his money, loves the girl at heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she will have it when they come to part.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Sir,” said the youth, his terrors all awake,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Hear me, I pray, I beg—for mercy’s sake!</div>
      <div class='line'>Sir, were the secrets of my soul confess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would you admit the truths that I protest      <span class='linenum'>550&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Are such——your pardon”——</div>
      <div class='line in24'>“Pardon! good, my friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>I not alone will pardon, I commend:</div>
      <div class='line'>Think you that I have no remembrance left</div>
      <div class='line'>Of youthful love, and Cupid’s cunning theft?</div>
      <div class='line'>How nymphs will listen when their swains persuade,</div>
      <div class='line'>How hearts are gain’d, and how exchange is made?—</div>
      <div class='line'>Come, sir, your hand”——</div>
      <div class='line in23'>“In mercy, hear me now!”</div>
      <div class='line'>“I cannot hear you, time will not allow.</div>
      <div class='line'>You know my station, what on me depends,</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever needed—but we part as friends;      <span class='linenum'>560&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And here comes one who will the whole explain,</div>
      <div class='line'>My better self—and we shall meet again.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Sir, I entreat”——</div>
      <div class='line in22'>“Then be entreaty made</div>
      <div class='line'>To her, a woman, one you may persuade;</div>
      <div class='line'>A little teasing, but she will comply,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And loves her niece too fondly to deny.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“O! he is mad, and miserable I!”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Exclaim’d the youth; “But let me now collect</div>
      <div class='line'>My scatter’d thoughts; I something must effect.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hurrying she came—“Now, what has he confess’d,      <span class='linenum'>570&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Ere I could come to set your heart at rest?</div>
      <div class='line'>What! he has grieved you! Yet he, too, approves</div>
      <div class='line'>The thing! but man will tease you, if he loves.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But now for business: tell me, did you think</div>
      <div class='line'>That we should always at your meetings wink?</div>
      <div class='line'>Think you, you walk’d unseen? There are who bring</div>
      <div class='line'>To me all secrets—O, you wicked thing!</div>
      <div class='line'>Poor Fanny! now I think I see her blush</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>All red and rosy, when I beat the bush;</div>
      <div class='line'>And ‘hide your secret,’ said I, ‘if you dare!’      <span class='linenum'>580&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So out it came, like an affrighten’d hare.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘Miss!’ said I, gravely; and the trembling maid</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleased me at heart to see her so afraid;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then she wept;—now, do remember this,</div>
      <div class='line'>Never to chide her when she does amiss;</div>
      <div class='line'>For she is tender as the callow bird,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cannot bear to have her temper stirr’d;—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Fanny,’ I said, then whisper’d her the name,</div>
      <div class='line'>And caused such looks—Yes, yours are just the same;</div>
      <div class='line'>But hear my story—When your love was known      <span class='linenum'>590&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For this our child—she is, in fact, our own—</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, first debating, we agreed at last</div>
      <div class='line'>To seek my lord, and tell him what had past.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“To tell the earl?”</div>
      <div class='line in22'>“Yes, truly, and why not?</div>
      <div class='line'>And then together we contrived our plot.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Eternal God!”</div>
      <div class='line in16'>“Nay, be not so surprised,—</div>
      <div class='line'>In all the matter we were well advised;</div>
      <div class='line'>We saw my lord, and Lady Jane was there,</div>
      <div class='line'>And said to Johnson, ‘Johnson, take a chair.’</div>
      <div class='line'>True, we are servants in a certain way,      <span class='linenum'>600}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But in the higher places so are they;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>We are obey’d in ours, and they in theirs obey.—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So Johnson bow’d, for that was right and fit,</div>
      <div class='line'>And had no scruple with the earl to sit—</div>
      <div class='line'>Why look you so impatient while I tell</div>
      <div class='line'>What they debated?—you must like it well.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘Let them go on,’ our gracious earl began;</div>
      <div class='line'>‘They will go off,’ said, joking, my good man:</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Well!’ said the countess—she’s a lover’s friend—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘What if they do? they make the speedier end.’——      <span class='linenum'>610&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But be you more composed, for that dear child</div>
      <div class='line'>Is with her joy and apprehension wild:</div>
      <div class='line'>O! we have watch’d you on from day to day,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘There go the lovers!’ we were wont to say—</div>
      <div class='line'>But why that look?”—</div>
      <div class='line in22'>“Dear madam, I implore</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>A single moment!”</div>
      <div class='line in18'>“I can give no more:</div>
      <div class='line'>Here are your letters—‘that’s a female pen,’</div>
      <div class='line'>Said I to Fanny—‘’tis his sister’s, then,’</div>
      <div class='line'>Replied the maid.—No! never must you stray;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or hide your wanderings, if you should, I pray;      <span class='linenum'>620&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I know, at least I fear, the best may err,</div>
      <div class='line'>But keep the by-walks of your life from her:</div>
      <div class='line'>That youth should stray is nothing to be told,</div>
      <div class='line'>When they have sanction in the grave and old,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who have no call to wander and transgress,</div>
      <div class='line'>But very love of change and wantonness.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I prattle idly, while your letters wait,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then my lord has much that he would state,</div>
      <div class='line'>All good to you—do clear that clouded face,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with good looks your lucky lot embrace.      <span class='linenum'>630&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Now, mind that none with her divide your heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>For she would die ere lose the smallest part;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I rejoice that all has gone so well,</div>
      <div class='line'>For who th’ effect of Johnson’s rage can tell?</div>
      <div class='line'>He had his fears when you began to meet,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I assured him there was no deceit.</div>
      <div class='line'>He is a man who kindness will requite,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, injured once, revenge is his delight;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he would spend the best of his estates</div>
      <div class='line'>To ruin, goods and body, them he hates;      <span class='linenum'>640&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>While he is kind enough when he approves</div>
      <div class='line'>A deed that’s done, and serves the man he loves.</div>
      <div class='line'>Come, read your letters—I must now be gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And think of matters that are coming on.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Henry was lost—his brain confused, his soul</div>
      <div class='line'>Dismay’d and sunk, his thoughts beyond control;</div>
      <div class='line'>Borne on by terror, he foreboding read</div>
      <div class='line'>Cecilia’s letter! and his courage fled;</div>
      <div class='line'>All was a gloomy, dark, and dreadful view,</div>
      <div class='line'>He felt him guilty, but indignant too:—      <span class='linenum'>650&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And as he read, he felt the high disdain</div>
      <div class='line'>Of injured men—“She may repent, in vain.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Cecilia much had heard, and told him all</div>
      <div class='line'>That scandal taught—“A servant at the hall,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Or servant’s daughter, in the kitchen bred,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose father would not with her mother wed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was now his choice! a blushing fool, the toy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or the attempted, both of man and boy;</div>
      <div class='line'>More than suspected, but without the wit</div>
      <div class='line'>Or the allurements for such creatures fit;      <span class='linenum'>660&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Not virtuous, though unfeeling; cold as ice,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet not chaste; the weeping fool of vice;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yielding, not tender; feeble, not refined;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her form insipid, and without a mind.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Rival! she spurn’d the word; but let him stay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Warn’d as he was, beyond the present day:</div>
      <div class='line'>Whate’er his patron might object to this,</div>
      <div class='line'>The uncle-butler, or the weeping miss—</div>
      <div class='line'>Let him from this one single day remain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then return he would to her in vain!      <span class='linenum'>670&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There let him then abide, to earn, or crave</div>
      <div class='line'>Food undeserved, and be with slaves a slave!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Had reason guided anger, govern’d zeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or chosen words to make a lover feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>She might have saved him—anger and abuse</div>
      <div class='line'>Will but defiance and revenge produce.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Unjust and cruel, insolent and proud!”</div>
      <div class='line'>He said, indignant; and he spoke aloud.</div>
      <div class='line'>“‘Butler’! and ‘servant’! Gentlest of thy sex,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou wouldst not thus a man who loved thee vex;      <span class='linenum'>680&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Thou wouldst not thus to vile report give ear,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor thus enraged for fancied crimes appear—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I know not what, dear maid!—if thy soft smiles were here.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>And then, that instant, there appear’d the maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>By his sad looks in her approach dismay’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such timid sweetness, and so wrong’d, did more</div>
      <div class='line'>Than all her pleading tenderness before.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In that weak moment, when disdain and pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fear and fondness, drew the man aside,</div>
      <div class='line'>In this weak moment—“Wilt thou,” he began,      <span class='linenum'>690&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Be mine?” and joy o’er all her features ran;</div>
      <div class='line'>“I will!” she softly whisper’d; but the roar</div>
      <div class='line'>Of cannon would not strike his spirit more;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Ev’n as his lips the lawless contract seal’d</div>
      <div class='line'>He felt that conscience lost her seven-fold shield,</div>
      <div class='line'>And honour fled; but still he spoke of love,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all was joy in the consenting dove.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That evening all in fond discourse was spent,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When the sad lover to his chamber went,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To think on what had past, to grieve and to repent.      <span class='linenum'>700}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Early he rose, and look’d with many a sigh</div>
      <div class='line'>On the red light that fill’d the eastern sky;</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft had he stood before, alert and gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>To hail the glories of the new-born day;</div>
      <div class='line'>But now dejected, languid, listless, low,</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw the wind upon the water blow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the cold stream curl’d onward as the gale</div>
      <div class='line'>From the pine-hill blew harshly down the dale.</div>
      <div class='line'>On the right side the youth a wood survey’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>With all its dark intensity of shade;      <span class='linenum'>710&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Where the rough wind alone was heard to move,</div>
      <div class='line'>In this, the pause of nature and of love,</div>
      <div class='line'>When now the young are rear’d, and when the old,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lost to the tie, grow negligent and cold—</div>
      <div class='line'>Far to the left he saw the huts of men,</div>
      <div class='line'>Half hid in mist, that hung upon the fen;</div>
      <div class='line'>Before him swallows, gathering for the sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>Took their short flights, and twitter’d on the lea;</div>
      <div class='line'>And near the bean-sheaf stood, the harvest done,</div>
      <div class='line'>And slowly blacken’d in the sickly sun;      <span class='linenum'>720&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>All these were sad in nature, or they took</div>
      <div class='line'>Sadness from him, the likeness of his look,</div>
      <div class='line'>And of his mind—he ponder’d for a while,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then met his Fanny with a borrow’d smile.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Not much remain’d; for money and my lord</div>
      <div class='line'>Soon made the father of the youth accord;</div>
      <div class='line'>His prudence half resisted, half obey’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And scorn kept still the guardians of the maid.</div>
      <div class='line'>Cecilia never on the subject spoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>She seem’d as one who from a dream awoke;      <span class='linenum'>730&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So all was peace, and soon the married pair</div>
      <div class='line'>Fix’d with fair fortune in a mansion fair.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Five years had past, and what was Henry then?</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>The most repining of repenting men;</div>
      <div class='line'>With a fond, teasing, anxious wife, afraid</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all attention to another paid;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, powerless she her husband to amuse</div>
      <div class='line'>Lives but t’ entreat, implore, resent, accuse;</div>
      <div class='line'>Jealous and tender, conscious of defects,</div>
      <div class='line'>She merits little, and yet much expects;      <span class='linenum'>740&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She looks for love that now she cannot see,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sighs for joy that never more can be;</div>
      <div class='line'>On his retirements her complaints intrude,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fond reproof endears his solitude;</div>
      <div class='line'>While he her weakness (once her kindness) sees,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his affections in her languor freeze;</div>
      <div class='line'>Regret, uncheck’d by hope, devours his mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>He feels unhappy, and he grows unkind.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Fool! to be taken by a rosy cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>And eyes that cease to sparkle or to speak;      <span class='linenum'>750&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Fool! for this child my freedom to resign,</div>
      <div class='line'>When one, the glory of her sex, was mine;</div>
      <div class='line'>While from this burthen to my soul I hide,</div>
      <div class='line'>To think what Fate has dealt, and what denied.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“What fiend possess’d me when I tamely gave</div>
      <div class='line'>My forced assent to be an idiot’s slave?</div>
      <div class='line'>Her beauty vanish’d, what for me remains?</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ eternal clicking of the galling chains.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her person truly I may think my own,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seen without pleasure, without triumph shown:      <span class='linenum'>760&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Doleful she sits, her children at her knees,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gives up all her feeble powers to please;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom I, unmoved, or moved with scorn, behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Melting as ice, as vapid and as cold.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such was his fate, and he must yet endure</div>
      <div class='line'>The self-contempt that no self-love can cure.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some business call’d him to a wealthy town</div>
      <div class='line'>When unprepared for more than Fortune’s frown;</div>
      <div class='line'>There at a house he gave his luckless name,</div>
      <div class='line'>The master absent, and Cecilia came.      <span class='linenum'>770&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Unhappy man! he could not, dared not speak,</div>
      <div class='line'>But look’d around, as if retreat to seek;</div>
      <div class='line'>This she allow’d not; but, with brow severe,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Ask’d him his business, sternly bent to hear.</div>
      <div class='line'>He had no courage, but he view’d that face      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As if he sought for sympathy and grace;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As if some kind returning thought to trace—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In vain; not long he waited, but, with air</div>
      <div class='line'>That of all grace compell’d him to despair,</div>
      <div class='line'>She rang the bell, and, when a servant came,      <span class='linenum'>780&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Left the repentant traitor to his shame;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, going, spoke, “Attend this person out,</div>
      <div class='line'>And if he speaks, hear what he comes about!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, with cool curtesy, from the room withdrew,</div>
      <div class='line'>That seem’d to say, “Unhappy man, adieu!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus will it be when man permits a vice</div>
      <div class='line'>First to invade his heart, and then entice;</div>
      <div class='line'>When wishes vain and undefined arise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And that weak heart deceive, seduce, surprise;</div>
      <div class='line'>When evil Fortune works on Folly’s side,      <span class='linenum'>790&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And rash Resentment adds a spur to Pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then life’s long troubles from these actions come,</div>
      <div class='line'>In which a moment may decide our doom.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>R</span>ichard one month had with his brother been,</div>
      <div class='line'>And had his guests, his friends, his favourites seen;</div>
      <div class='line'>Had heard the rector, who with decent force,</div>
      <div class='line'>But not of action, aided his discourse:</div>
      <div class='line'>“A moral teacher!” some, contemptuous, cried;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He smiled, but nothing of the fact denied,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor, save by his fair life, to charge so strong replied.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Still, though he bade them not on aught rely      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That was their own, but all their worth deny,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They call’d his pure advice his cold morality;      <span class='linenum'>10}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And though he felt that earnestness and zeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>That made some portion of his hearers feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, though he loved the minds of men to lead</div>
      <div class='line'>To the great points that form the Christian’s creed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still he offended; for he would discuss</div>
      <div class='line'>Points that to him seem’d requisite for us,</div>
      <div class='line'>And urge his flock to virtue, though he knew</div>
      <div class='line'>The very heathen taught the virtues too.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor was this moral minister afraid</div>
      <div class='line'>To ask of inspiration’s self the aid      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of truths by him so sturdily maintain’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>That some confusion in the parish reign’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Heathens,” they said, “can tell us right from wrong,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>But to a Christian higher points belong.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet Jacques proceeded, void of fear and shame,</div>
      <div class='line'>In his old method, and obtain’d the name</div>
      <div class='line'>Of <i>Moral Preacher</i>—yet they all agreed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whatever error had defiled his creed,</div>
      <div class='line'>His life was pure, and him they could commend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not as their guide, indeed, but as their friend;      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Truth, justice, pity, and a love of peace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were his—but there must approbation cease;</div>
      <div class='line'>He either did not, or he would not see,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, if he meant a favourite priest to be,</div>
      <div class='line'>He must not show, but learn of them, the way</div>
      <div class='line'>To truth—he must not dictate, but obey.</div>
      <div class='line'>They wish’d him not to bring them further light,</div>
      <div class='line'>But to convince them that they now were right,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to assert that justice will condemn</div>
      <div class='line'>All who presumed to disagree with them.      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In this he fail’d; and his the greater blame,</div>
      <div class='line'>For he persisted, void of fear or shame.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Him Richard heard, and by his friendly aid</div>
      <div class='line'>Were pleasant views observed and visits paid;</div>
      <div class='line'>He to peculiar people found his way,</div>
      <div class='line'>And had his question answer’d, “Who are they?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Twice in the week came letters, and delight</div>
      <div class='line'>Beam’d in the eye of Richard at the sight:</div>
      <div class='line'>Letters of love, all full and running o’er;</div>
      <div class='line'>The paper fill’d till it could hold no more;      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Cross’d with discolour’d ink, the doublings full—</div>
      <div class='line'>No fear that love should find abundance dull;</div>
      <div class='line'>Love reads unsated all that love inspires;</div>
      <div class='line'>When most indulged, indulgence still requires;</div>
      <div class='line'>Looks what the corners, what the crossings tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lifts each folding for a fond farewell.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>George saw and smiled—“To lovers we allow</div>

      <div class='line'>Since you affirm’d that I could not be wrong;</div>
      <div class='line'>I told you then—you recollect, I told</div>
      <div class='line'>The very truth—that humour would not hold;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not that I thought, or ever could suppose,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The mighty raptures were so soon to close—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Poetic flights of love all sunk in sullen prose.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Do you remember how you used to hang      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Upon my looks? your transports when I sang?</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>I play’d—you melted into tears; I moved—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Voice, words, and motion, how you all approved;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A time when Emma reign’d, a time when Henry loved.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>You recollect?</div>
      <div class='line'><i>H.</i>            Yes, surely; and then why</div>
      <div class='line'>The needless truths? do I the facts deny?</div>
      <div class='line'>For this remonstrance I can see no need,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or this impatience—if you do, proceed.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>E.</i> O! that is now so cool, and with a smile</div>
      <div class='line'>That sharpens insult—I detest the style;      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, now I talk of styles, with what delight</div>

      <div class='line'>In short, when I was present you could see</div>
      <div class='line'>But one dear object, and you lived for me;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now, sir, what your pleasure? Let me dress,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sing, speak, or write, and you your sense express</div>
      <div class='line'>Of my poor taste—my words are not correct;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In all I do is failing or defect—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Some error you will seek, some blunder will detect;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And what can such dissatisfaction prove?      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I tell you, Henry, you have ceased to love.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>H.</i> I own it not; but if a truth it be,</div>
      <div class='line'>It is the fault of nature, not of me.</div>
      <div class='line'>Remember you, my love, the fairy tale,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the young pairs were spell-bound in the vale?</div>
      <div class='line'>When all around them gay or glorious seem’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And of bright views and ceaseless joys they dream’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Young love and infant life no more could give—</div>
      <div class='line'>They said but half, when they exclaim’d, “We live!”</div>
      <div class='line'>All was so light, so lovely, so serene,      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And not a trouble to be heard or seen;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till, melting into truth, the vision fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there came miry roads and thorny ways instead.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such was our fate, my charmer! we were found</div>
      <div class='line'>A wandering pair, by roguish Cupid bound;</div>
      <div class='line'>All that I saw was gifted to inspire      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Grand views of bliss, and wake intense desire      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of joys that never pall, of flights that never tire;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There was that purple light of love, that bloom,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>That pure enjoyment of the soul—O! weak</div>

      <div class='line'>Of my own effort; all attempts were vain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nor they alone were charming; by that light</div>
      <div class='line'>All loved of thee grew lovely in my sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet influence not its own in every place</div>

      <div class='line'>Thy shrubs and plants were seen new bloom to bear;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Not the Arabian sweets so fragrant were,      <span class='linenum'>180}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor Eden’s self, if aught with Eden might compare.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>You went the church-way walk, you reach’d the farm,</div>

      <div class='line'>Thenceforth was more than Pegasus to me.</div>

      <div class='line'>To me the paw and greeting of a friend?</div>
      <div class='line'>And all his surly ugliness forgave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because, like me, he was my Emma’s slave?</div>
      <div class='line'>Think you, thus charm’d, I would the spell revoke?      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'><i>E.</i> O! sir, this boyish tale is mighty well,</div>
      <div class='line'>But ’twas your falsehood that destroy’d the spell.      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Speak not of nature; ’tis an evil mind      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That makes you to accustom’d beauties blind;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>You seek the faults yourself, and then complain you find.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'><i>H.</i> I sought them not; but, madam, ’tis in vain</div>

      <div class='line'>Lo! when the buds expand the leaves are green,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then the first opening of the flower is seen;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then comes the honied breath and rosy smile,</div>
      <div class='line'>That with their sweets the willing sense beguile;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, as we look, and love, and taste, and praise,      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>And the fruit grows, the charming flower decays;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>So ’tis with beauty—such the opening grace</div>

      <div class='line'>The bud, the bloom, the fruit—and then we fade.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then sigh no more—we might as well retain</div>
      <div class='line'>The year’s gay prime as bid that love remain:</div>
      <div class='line'>That fond, delusive, happy, transient spell,</div>
      <div class='line'>That hides us from a world wherein we dwell,</div>
      <div class='line'>And forms and fits us for that fairy ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where charming dreams and gay conceits abound;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till comes at length th’ awakening strife and care,</div>
      <div class='line'>That we, as tried and toiling men, must share.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>E.</i> O! sir, I must not think that heaven approves      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Ungrateful man or unrequited loves;</div>

      <div class='line'><i>H.</i> Come, my dear friend, and let us not refuse</div>

      <div class='line'>This must relieve the ill, and may redress.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>E.</i> O! much I fear! I practised no deceit;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as I am I saw you at my feet;</div>
      <div class='line'>If for a goddess you a girl would take,      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>Now raised to rapture, now to terror doom’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>Was not the goddess by the girl assumed?</div>
      <div class='line'>Did not my Emma use her skill to hide—</div>
      <div class='line'>Let us be frank—her weakness and her pride?</div>
      <div class='line'>Did she not all her sex’s arts pursue,</div>
      <div class='line'>To bring the angel forward to my view?</div>
      <div class='line'>Was not the rising anger oft suppress’d?      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Was not the waking passion hush’d to rest?</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when so mildly sweet you look’d and spoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>Did not the woman deign to wear a cloak?</div>
      <div class='line'>A cloak she wore, or, though not clear my sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>I might have seen her—Think you not I might?</div>
      <div class='line'><i>E.</i> O! this is glorious!—while your passion lives,</div>

      <div class='line'><i>H.</i> For this, my Emma, I to Heaven appeal,      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I felt entirely what I seem’d to feel;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou wert all precious in my sight, to me</div>
      <div class='line'>The being angels are supposed to be;</div>
      <div class='line'>And am I now of my deception told,</div>

      <div class='line'>Mean you that I by art or caution tried</div>
      <div class='line'>To show a virtue, or a fault to hide?</div>
      <div class='line'><i>H.</i> I will obey you—When you seem’d to feel      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Those books we read, and praised them with such zeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>Approving all that certain friends approved,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was it the pages, or the praise you loved?</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, do not frown—I much rejoiced to find</div>
      <div class='line'>Such early judgment in such gentle mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, since we married, have you deign’d to look</div>
      <div class='line'>On the grave subjects of one favourite book?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or have the once-applauded pages power</div>
      <div class='line'>T’ engage their warm approver for an hour?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nay, hear me further—When we view’d that dell,      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Where lie those ruins—you must know it well—</div>
      <div class='line'>When that worn pediment your walk delay’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the stream gushing through the arch decay’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>When at the venerable pile you stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the does ventured on our solitude,</div>
      <div class='line'>We were so still! before the growing day</div>
      <div class='line'>Call’d us reluctant from our seat away—</div>
      <div class='line'>Tell me, was all the feeling you express’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The genuine feeling of my Emma’s breast?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or was it borrow’d, that her faithful slave      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>The higher notion of her taste might have?</div>
      <div class='line'>So may I judge, for of that lovely scene</div>
      <div class='line'>The married Emma has no witness been;</div>
      <div class='line'>No more beheld that water, falling, flow</div>
      <div class='line'>Through the green fern that there delights to grow.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Once more permit me——Well, I know, you feel</div>
      <div class='line'>For suffering men, and would their sufferings heal,</div>
      <div class='line'>But when at certain huts you chose to call,</div>
      <div class='line'>At certain seasons, was compassion all?</div>
      <div class='line'>I there beheld thee, to the wretched dear      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As angels to expiring saints appear</div>
      <div class='line'>When whispering hope—I saw an infant press’d</div>
      <div class='line'>And hush’d to slumber on my Emma’s breast!</div>
      <div class='line'>Hush’d be each rude suggestion!—Well I know,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a free hand your bounty you bestow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to these objects frequent comforts send;</div>
      <div class='line'>But still they see not now their pitying friend.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A merchant, Emma, when his wealth he states,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though rich, is faulty if he over-rates</div>
      <div class='line'>His real store; and, gaining greater trust      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For the deception, should we deem him just?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>If in your singleness of heart you hide</div>
      <div class='line'>No flaw or frailty, when your truth is tried,</div>
      <div class='line'>And time has drawn aside the veil of love—</div>
      <div class='line'>We may be sorry, but we must approve;</div>
      <div class='line'>The fancied charms no more our praise compel,</div>
      <div class='line'>But doubly shines the worth that stands so well.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>E.</i> O! precious are you all, and prizes too,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or could we take such guilty pains for you?</div>
      <div class='line'>Believe it not—As long as passion lasts,      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A charm about the chosen maid it casts;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the poor girl has little more to do</div>
      <div class='line'>Than just to keep in sight as you pursue.</div>
      <div class='line'>Chance to a ruin leads her; you behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And straight the angel of her taste is told;</div>
      <div class='line'>Chance to a cottage leads you, and you trace</div>
      <div class='line'>A virtuous pity in the angel’s face;</div>
      <div class='line'>She reads a work you chance to recommend,</div>
      <div class='line'>And likes it well—at least, she likes the friend;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, when it chances this no more is done,      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>She has not left one virtue—No! not one!</div>

      <div class='line'>Is it not done to hold a fickle heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fix a roving eye?—Is that design</div>
      <div class='line'>Shameful or wicked that would keep you mine?</div>
      <div class='line'>If I confess the art, I would proceed</div>
      <div class='line'>To say of such that every maid has need.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then, when you flatter—in your language, praise—</div>
      <div class='line'>In our own view you must our value raise;</div>

      <div class='line'>Appear as like his picture as we can?</div>
      <div class='line'>If you will call—nay, treat us as—divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Must we not something to your thoughts incline?</div>
      <div class='line'>If men of sense will worship whom they love,</div>

      <div class='line'>What! show him all her glory is pretence,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Then, too, suppose we should his praise refuse,</div>
      <div class='line'>And clear his mind, we may our lover lose;</div>
      <div class='line'>In fact, you make us more than nature makes,      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And we, no doubt, consent to your mistakes;</div>
      <div class='line'>You will, we know, until the frenzy cools,</div>
      <div class='line'>Enjoy the transient paradise of fools;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, fancy fled, you quit the blissful state,</div>
      <div class='line'>And truth for ever bars the golden gate.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>H.</i> True! but how ill each other to upbraid,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis not our fault that we no longer staid;</div>
      <div class='line'>No sudden fate our lingering love supprest;</div>
      <div class='line'>It died an easy death, and calmly sank to rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>To either sex is the delusion lent;      <span class='linenum'>360}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, when it fails us, we should rest content;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis cruel to reproach, when bootless to repent.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'><i>E.</i> Then wise the lovers who consent to wait,</div>

      <div class='line'>A spell is utter’d, and a ring applied,</div>

      <div class='line'>Was steril, wild, deform’d, and beings rude</div>
      <div class='line'>Creatures scarce wilder than themselves pursued.</div>
      <div class='line'>The sea was heard around a waste to howl;</div>
      <div class='line'>The night-wolf answer’d to the whooting owl;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all was wretched—Yet who now surveys</div>
      <div class='line'>The land, withholds his wonder and his praise?      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Come, let us try and make our moral view</div>
      <div class='line'>Improve like this—this have we power to do.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>E.</i> O! I’ll be all forgetful, deaf and dumb,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all you wish, to have these changes come.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>H.</i> And come they may; if not as heretofore,</div>
      <div class='line'>We cannot all the lovely vase restore;</div>
      <div class='line'>What we beheld in Love’s perspective glass</div>
      <div class='line'>Has pass’d away—one sigh! and let it pass.</div>
      <div class='line'>It was a blissful vision, and it fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we must get some actual good instead:      <span class='linenum'>410&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Of good and evil that we daily find,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>That</i> we must hoard, <i>this</i> banish from the mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>The food of Love, that food on which he thrives,</div>
      <div class='line'>To find must be the business of our lives;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when we know what Love delights to see,</div>
      <div class='line'>We must his guardians and providers be.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As careful peasants, with incessant toil,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bring earth to vines in bare and rocky soil,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as they raise with care each scanty heap,</div>
      <div class='line'>Think of the purple clusters they shall reap:      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So those accretions to the mind we’ll bring,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whence fond regard and just esteem will spring;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, though we backward look with some regret</div>
      <div class='line'>On those first joys, we shall be happy yet.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Each on the other must in all depend,</div>
      <div class='line'>The kind adviser, the unfailing friend;</div>
      <div class='line'>Through the rough world we must each other aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Leading and led, obeying and obey’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Favour’d and favouring, eager to believe</div>
      <div class='line'>What should be truth—unwilling to perceive      <span class='linenum'>430&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What might offend—determined to remove      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What has offended, wisely to improve      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What pleases yet, and guard returning love.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nor doubt, my Emma, but in many an hour</div>
      <div class='line'>Fancy, who sleeps, shall wake with all her power;</div>
      <div class='line'>And we shall pass—though not perhaps remain—</div>
      <div class='line'>To fairy-land, and feel its charm again.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>“I</span> met,” said Richard, when return’d to dine,</div>
      <div class='line'>“In my excursion, with a friend of mine;</div>
      <div class='line'>Friend! I mistake—but yet I knew him well,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ours was the village where he came to dwell;</div>
      <div class='line'>He was an orphan born to wealth, and then</div>
      <div class='line'>Placed in the guardian-care of cautious men;</div>
      <div class='line'>When our good parent, who was kindness all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fed and caress’d him when he chose to call;</div>
      <div class='line'>And this he loved, for he was always one</div>
      <div class='line'>For whom some pleasant service must be done,      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or he was sullen—He would come and play</div>
      <div class='line'>At his own time, and at his pleasure stay;</div>
      <div class='line'>But our kind parent soothed him as a boy      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Without a friend; she loved he should enjoy      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A day of ease, and strove to give his mind employ.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She had but seldom the desired success,</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore parting troubled her the less;</div>
      <div class='line'>Two years he there remain’d; then went his way—</div>
      <div class='line'>I think to school; and him I met to-day.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I heard his name, or he had past unknown;      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, without scruple, I divulged my own.</div>
      <div class='line'>His words were civil, but not much express’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Yes! he had heard I was my brother’s guest’;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Then would explain, what was not plain to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Why he could not a social neighbour be.</div>
      <div class='line'>He envied you, he said, your quiet life,</div>
      <div class='line'>And me a loving and contented wife;</div>
      <div class='line'>You, as unfetter’d by domestic bond,</div>
      <div class='line'>Me, as a husband and a father fond.</div>
      <div class='line'>I was about to speak, when to the right      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The road then turn’d, and lo! his house in sight.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘Adieu!’ he said, nor gave a word or sign</div>
      <div class='line'>Of invitation—‘Yonder house is mine;</div>
      <div class='line'>Your brother’s I prefer, if I might choose—</div>
      <div class='line'>But, my dear sir, you have no time to lose.’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Say, is he poor? or has he fits of spleen?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or is he melancholy, moped, or mean?</div>
      <div class='line'>So cold, so distant——I bestow’d some pains</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the fever in my Irish veins.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Well, Richard, let your native wrath be tamed;      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The man has half the evils you have named:</div>
      <div class='line'>He is not poor, indeed, nor is he free</div>
      <div class='line'>From all the gloom and care of poverty.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But is he married?”—“Hush! the bell, my friend;</div>
      <div class='line'>That business done, we will to this attend;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, o’er our wine engaged, and at our ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>We may discourse of Belwood’s miseries;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not that his sufferings please me—No, indeed;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I from such am happy to be freed.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Their speech, of course, to this misfortune led      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A weak young man improvidently wed.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Weak,” answer’d Richard; “but we do him wrong</div>
      <div class='line'>To say that his affection was not strong.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“That we may doubt,” said George; “in men so weak</div>
      <div class='line'>You may in vain the strong affections seek;</div>
      <div class='line'>They have strong appetites; a fool will eat</div>
      <div class='line'>As long as food is to his palate sweet;</div>
      <div class='line'>His rule is not what sober nature needs,</div>
      <div class='line'>But what the palate covets as he feeds;</div>
      <div class='line'>He has the passions, anger, envy, fear,      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As storm is angry, and as frost severe;</div>
      <div class='line'>Uncheck’d, he still retains what nature gave,</div>
      <div class='line'>And has what creatures of the forest have.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Weak boys, indulged by parents just as weak,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will with much force of their affection speak;</div>
      <div class='line'>But let mamma th’ accustom’d sweets withhold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the fond boys grow insolent and cold.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Weak men profess to love, and while untried</div>
      <div class='line'>May woo with warmth, and grieve to be denied;</div>
      <div class='line'>But this is selfish ardour—all the zeal      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of their pursuit is from the wish they feel</div>
      <div class='line'>For self indulgence—When do they deny      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Themselves? and when the favourite object fly?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or, for that object’s sake, with her requests comply?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Their sickly love is fed with hopes of joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Repulses damp it, and delays destroy;</div>
      <div class='line'>Love, that to virtuous acts will some excite,</div>
      <div class='line'>In others but provokes an appetite.</div>
      <div class='line'>In better minds, when love possession takes</div>
      <div class='line'>And meets with peril, he the reason shakes;      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But these weak natures, when they love profess,</div>
      <div class='line'>Never regard their small concerns the less.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“That true and genuine love has Quixote-flights</div>
      <div class='line'>May be allow’d—in vision it delights;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, in its loftiest flight, its wildest dream</div>
      <div class='line'>Has something in it that commands esteem.</div>
      <div class='line'>But this poor love to no such region soars,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, Sancho-like, its selfish loss deplores;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of its own merit and its service speaks,</div>
      <div class='line'>And full reward for all its duty seeks.”—      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“When a rich boy, with all the pride of youth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Weds a poor beauty, will you doubt his truth?</div>
      <div class='line'>Such love is tried—it indiscreet may be,</div>
      <div class='line'>But must be generous”—</div>
      <div class='line in25'>“That I do not see.</div>
      <div class='line'>Just at this time the balance of the mind</div>
      <div class='line'>Is this or that way by the weights inclined;</div>
      <div class='line'>In this scale beauty, wealth in that abides,</div>
      <div class='line'>In dubious balance, till the last subsides;</div>
      <div class='line'>Things are not poised in just the equal state,</div>
      <div class='line'>That the ass stands stock-still in the debate;      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Though, when deciding, he may slowly pass</div>
      <div class='line'>And long for both—the nature of the ass;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>’Tis but an impulse that he must obey,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he resigns one bundle of the hay.”</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Take your friend Belwood, whom his guardians sent</div>
      <div class='line'>To Doctor Sidmere—full of dread he went;</div>
      <div class='line'>Doctor they call’d him—he was not of us,</div>
      <div class='line'>And where he was—we need not now discuss.</div>
      <div class='line'>He kept a school; he had a daughter fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>He said, as angels—say, as women—are.      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Clara, this beauty, had a figure light;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her face was handsome, and her eyes were bright;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her voice was music, not by anger raised;</div>
      <div class='line'>And sweet her dimple, either pleased or praised;</div>
      <div class='line'>All round the village was her fame allow’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>She was its pride, and not a little proud.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The ruling thought that sway’d her father’s mind</div>
      <div class='line'>Was this—I am for dignity design’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>Riches he rather as a mean approved,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet sought them early, and in seeking loved;      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For this he early made the marriage vow,</div>
      <div class='line'>But fail’d to gain—I recollect not how;</div>
      <div class='line'>For this his lady had his wrath incurr’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>But that her feelings seldom could be stirr’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>To his fair daughter, famed as well as fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>He look’d, and found his consolation there.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Doctor taught of youth some half a score,</div>
      <div class='line'>Well-born and wealthy—He would take no more;</div>
      <div class='line'>His wife, when peevish, told him, “Yes! and glad”—</div>
      <div class='line'>It might be so—no more were to be had.      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Belwood, it seems, for college was design’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>But for more study he was not inclined;</div>
      <div class='line'>He thought of labouring there with much dismay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And motives mix’d here urged the long delay.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He now on manhood verged, at least began</div>
      <div class='line'>To talk as he supposed became a man.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Whether he chose the college or the school</div>
      <div class='line'>Was his own act, and that should no man rule;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>He had his reasons for the step he took;</div>
      <div class='line'>Did they suppose he stay’d to read his book?”      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hopeless, the Doctor said, “This boy is one</div>
      <div class='line'>With whom I fear there’s nothing to be done.”</div>
      <div class='line'>His wife replied, who more had guess’d or knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>“You only mean there’s nothing he can do;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ev’n there you err, unless you mean indeed</div>
      <div class='line'>That the poor lad can neither think nor read.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“What credit can I by such dunce obtain?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Credit? I know not—you may something gain;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis true he has no passion for his books,</div>
      <div class='line'>But none can closer study Clara’s looks;      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And who controls him? now his father’s gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s not a creature cares about the son.</div>
      <div class='line'>If he be brought to ask your daughter’s hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>All that he has will be at her command;</div>
      <div class='line'>And who is she? and whom does she obey?</div>
      <div class='line'>Where is the wrong, and what the danger, pray?</div>
      <div class='line'>Becoming guide to one who guidance needs</div>
      <div class='line'>Is merit surely—If the thing succeeds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cannot you always keep him at your side,</div>
      <div class='line'>And be his honour’d guardian and his guide?      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And cannot I my pretty Clara rule?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is not this better than a noisy school?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Doctor thought and mused; he felt and fear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Wish’d it to be—then wish’d he had not heard;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he was angry—that at least was right,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gave him credit in his lady’s sight;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, milder grown, yet something still severe,</div>
      <div class='line'>He said, “Consider, Madam, think and fear;”</div>
      <div class='line'>But, ere they parted, softening to a smile,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Farewell!” said he—“I’ll think myself awhile.”      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>James and his Clara had, with many a pause</div>
      <div class='line'>And many a doubt, infringed the Doctor’s laws;</div>
      <div class='line'>At first with terror, and with eyes turn’d round</div>
      <div class='line'>On every side for fear they should be found,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the long passage, and without the gate,</div>
      <div class='line'>They met, and talk’d of love and his estate;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet little notes, and full of hope, were laid</div>
      <div class='line'>Where they were found by the attentive maid;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>And these she answer’d kindly as she could,</div>
      <div class='line'>But still ‘I dare not’ waited on ‘I would;’      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her fears and wishes she in part confess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her thoughts and views she carefully suppress’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her Jemmy said at length, “He did not heed</div>
      <div class='line'>His guardian’s anger—What was he, indeed?</div>
      <div class='line'>A tradesman once, and had his fortune gain’d</div>
      <div class='line'>In that low way—such anger he disdain’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>He loved her pretty looks, her eyes of blue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her auburn-braid, and lips that shone like dew;</div>
      <div class='line'>And did she think her Jemmy stay’d at school</div>
      <div class='line'>To study Greek?—What, take him for a fool?      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Not he, by Jove! for what he had to seek</div>
      <div class='line'>He would in English ask her, not in Greek;</div>
      <div class='line'>Will you be mine? are all your scruples gone?</div>
      <div class='line'>Then let’s be off—I’ve that will take us on.”</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas true; the clerk of an attorney there</div>
      <div class='line'>Had found a Jew—the Jew supplied the heir.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet had he fears—“My guardians may condemn</div>
      <div class='line'>The choice I make—but what is that to them?</div>
      <div class='line'>The more they strive my pleasure to restrain,</div>
      <div class='line'>The less they’ll find they’re likely to obtain;      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For when they work one to a proper cue,</div>
      <div class='line'>What they forbid one takes delight to do.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Clara exulted—now the day would come</div>
      <div class='line'>Belwood must take her in her carriage home;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Then I shall hear what Envy will remark,</div>
      <div class='line'>When I shall sport the ponies in the park;</div>
      <div class='line'>When my friend Jane will meet me at the ball,</div>
      <div class='line'>And see me taken out the first of all;</div>
      <div class='line'>I see her looks when she beholds the men</div>
      <div class='line'>All crowd about me—she will simper then,      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And cry with her affected air and voice,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘O! my sweet Clara, how do I rejoice</div>
      <div class='line'>At your good fortune!’—‘Thank you, dear,’ say I;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Mamma look’d on with thoughts to these allied;</div>
      <div class='line'>She felt the pleasure of reflected pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>She should respect in Clara’s honour find—</div>
      <div class='line'>But she to Clara’s secret thoughts was blind;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>O! when we thus design we do but spread</div>
      <div class='line'>Nets for our feet, and to our toils are led;      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Those whom we think we rule their views attain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we partake the guilt without the gain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Doctor long had thought, till he became</div>
      <div class='line'>A victim both to avarice and shame;</div>
      <div class='line'>From his importance, every eye was placed</div>
      <div class='line'>On his designs—How dreadful if disgraced!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“O! that unknown to him the pair had flown</div>
      <div class='line'>To that same Green, the project all their own!</div>
      <div class='line'>And, should they now be guilty of the act,</div>
      <div class='line'>Am not I free from knowledge of the fact?      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Will they not, if they will?”—’Tis thus we meet</div>
      <div class='line'>The check of conscience, and our guide defeat.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This friend, this spy, this counsellor at rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>More pleasing views were to the mind address’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The mischief done, he would be much displeased,</div>
      <div class='line'>For weeks, nay, months, and slowly be appeased—</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet of this anger if they felt the dread,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps they dare not steal away to wed;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if on hints of mercy they should go,</div>
      <div class='line'>He stood committed—it must not be so.      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>In this dilemma either horn was hard—</div>
      <div class='line'>Best to seem careless, then, and off one’s guard;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, lest their terror should their flight prevent,</div>
      <div class='line'>His wife might argue—fathers will relent</div>
      <div class='line'>On such occasions—and that she should share</div>
      <div class='line'>The guilt and censure was her proper care.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Suppose them wed,” said he, “and at my feet,</div>
      <div class='line'>I must exclaim that instant—‘Vile deceit!’</div>
      <div class='line'>Then will my daughter, weeping while they kneel,</div>
      <div class='line'>For its own Clara beg my heart may feel:      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At last, but slowly, I may all forgive,</div>
      <div class='line'>And their adviser and director live.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When wishes only weak the heart surprise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Heaven, in its mercy, the fond prayer denies;</div>
      <div class='line'>But when our wishes are both base and weak,</div>
      <div class='line'>Heaven, in its justice, gives us what we seek.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>All pass’d that was expected; all prepared</div>
      <div class='line'>To share the comfort—What the comfort shared?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The married pair, on their return, agreed</div>
      <div class='line'>That they from school were now completely freed;      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Were man and wife, and to their mansion now</div>
      <div class='line'>Should boldly drive, and their intents avow:</div>
      <div class='line'>The acting guardian in the mansion reign’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, thither driving, they their will explain’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>The man awhile discoursed in language high,</div>
      <div class='line'>The ward was sullen, and made brief reply;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till, when he saw th’ opposing strength decline,</div>
      <div class='line'>He bravely utter’d—“Sir, the house is mine!”</div>
      <div class='line'>And, like a lion, lash’d by self-rebuke,</div>
      <div class='line'>His own defence he bravely undertook.      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Well! be it right or wrong, the thing is past;</div>
      <div class='line'>You cannot hinder what is tight and fast:</div>
      <div class='line'>The church has tied us; we are hither come</div>
      <div class='line'>To our own place, and you must make us room.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The man reflected—“You deserve, I know,</div>
      <div class='line'>Foolish young man! what fortune will bestow;</div>
      <div class='line'>No punishment from me your actions need,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose pains will shortly to your fault succeed.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James was quite angry, wondering what was meant</div>
      <div class='line'>By such expressions—Why should he repent?      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>New trial came—The wife conceived it right</div>
      <div class='line'>To see her parents; “So,” he said, “she might,</div>
      <div class='line'>If she had any fancy for a jail,</div>
      <div class='line'>But upon him no creature should prevail;</div>
      <div class='line'>No! he would never be again the fool</div>
      <div class='line'>To go and starve, or study at a school!”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“O! but to see her parents!”—“Well! the sight</div>
      <div class='line'>Might give her pleasure—very like it might,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she might go; but, to his house restored,</div>
      <div class='line'>He would not now be catechised and bored.”—      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“It was her duty”—“Well!” said he again,</div>
      <div class='line'>“There you may go—and there you may remain!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Already this?—Even so: he heard it said</div>
      <div class='line'>How rash and heedless was the part he play’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>For love of money in his spirit dwelt,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there repentance was intensely felt.</div>
      <div class='line'>His guardian told him he had bought a toy</div>
      <div class='line'>At tenfold price, and bargain’d like a boy;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Angry at truth, and wrought to fierce disdain,</div>
      <div class='line'>He swore his loss should be no woman’s gain;      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His table she might share, his name she must;</div>
      <div class='line'>But if aught more—she gets it upon trust.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For a few weeks his pride her face display’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>He then began to thwart her, and upbraid;</div>
      <div class='line'>He grew imperious, insolent, and loud—</div>
      <div class='line'>His blinded weakness made his folly proud;</div>
      <div class='line'>He would be master—she had no pretence</div>
      <div class='line'>To counsel him, as if he wanted sense;</div>
      <div class='line'>He must inform her, she already cost</div>
      <div class='line'>More than her worth, and more should not be lost;      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But still concluding, “if your will be so</div>
      <div class='line'>That you must see the old ones, do it—go!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Some weeks the Doctor waited, and the while</div>
      <div class='line'>His lady preach’d in no consoling style;</div>
      <div class='line'>At last she fear’d that rustic had convey’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Their child to prison—yes, she was afraid,—</div>
      <div class='line'>There to remain in that old hall alone</div>
      <div class='line'>With the vile heads of stags, and floors of stone.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Why did you, sir, who know such things so well,</div>
      <div class='line'>And teach us good, permit them to rebel?      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Had you o’erawed and check’d them when in sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>They would not then have ventured upon flight—</div>
      <div class='line'>Had you”——“Out, serpent! did not you begin?</div>
      <div class='line'>What! introduce, and then upbraid, the sin?</div>
      <div class='line'>For sin it is, as I too well perceive;</div>
      <div class='line'>But leave me, woman, to reflection leave;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then to your closet fly, and on your knees</div>
      <div class='line'>Beg for forgiveness for such sins as these.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“A moody morning!” with a careless air</div>
      <div class='line'>Replied the wife—“Why counsel me to prayer?      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I think the lord and teacher of a school</div>
      <div class='line'>Should pray himself, and keep his temper cool.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Calm grew the husband when the wife was gone—</div>
      <div class='line'>“The game,” said he, “is never lost till won.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis true, the rebels fly their proper home,</div>
      <div class='line'>They come not nigh, because they fear to come;</div>
      <div class='line'>And for my purpose fear will doubtless prove</div>
      <div class='line'>Of more importance and effect than love.—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Suppose me there—suppose the carriage stops:</div>
      <div class='line'>Down on her knees my trembling daughter drops;      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Slowly I raise her, in my arms to fall,</div>
      <div class='line'>And call for mercy as she used to call;</div>
      <div class='line'>And shall that boy, who dreaded to appear</div>
      <div class='line'>Before me, cast away at once his fear?</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis not in nature! He who once would cower</div>
      <div class='line'>Beneath my frown, and sob for half an hour;</div>
      <div class='line'>He who would kneel with motion prompt and quick</div>
      <div class='line'>If I but look’d—as dogs that do a trick;</div>
      <div class='line'>He still his knee-joints flexible must feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>And have a slavish promptitude to kneel;      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Soon as he sees me he will drop his lip,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bend like one made ready for the whip.</div>
      <div class='line'>O! come, I trifle, let me haste away—</div>
      <div class='line'>What! throw it up, when I have cards to play?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Doctor went, a self-invited guest;</div>
      <div class='line'>He met his pupil, and his frown repress’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>For in those lowering looks he could discern</div>
      <div class='line'>Resistance sullen and defiance stern;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet was it painful to put off his style</div>
      <div class='line'>Of awful distance, and assume a smile:      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So between these, the gracious and the grand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Succeeded nothing that the Doctor plann’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The sullen youth, with some reviving dread,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bow’d and then hang’d disconsolate his head;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, muttering welcome in a muffled tone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stalk’d cross the park to meditate alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Saying, or rather seeming to have said,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Go! seek your daughter, and be there obey’d.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He went—The daughter her distresses told,</div>
      <div class='line'>But found her father to her interests cold;      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He kindness and complacency advised;</div>
      <div class='line'>She answer’d, “these were sure to be despised;</div>
      <div class='line'>That of the love her husband once possess’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Not the least spark was living in his breast;</div>
      <div class='line'>The boy repented, and grew savage soon;</div>
      <div class='line'>There never shone for her a honey-moon.</div>
      <div class='line'>Soon as he came, his cares all fix’d on one—</div>
      <div class='line'>Himself, and all his passion was a gun;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>And, though he shot as he did all beside,</div>
      <div class='line'>It still remained his only joy and pride.      <span class='linenum'>380&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He left her there—she knew not where he went—</div>
      <div class='line'>But knew full well he should the slight repent;</div>
      <div class='line'>She was not one his daily taunts to bear,</div>
      <div class='line'>He made the house a hell that he should share;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, till he gave her power herself to please,</div>
      <div class='line'>Never for him should be a moment’s ease.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“He loves you, child!” the softening father cried.—</div>
      <div class='line'>He loves himself, and not a soul beside.</div>
      <div class='line'>Loves me!—why, yes, and so he did the pears</div>
      <div class='line'>You caught him stealing—would he had the fears!      <span class='linenum'>390&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Would you could make him tremble for his life,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then to you return the stolen wife,</div>
      <div class='line'>Richly endow’d—but, O! the idiot knows</div>
      <div class='line'>The worth of every penny he bestows.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Were he but fool alone, I’d find a way</div>
      <div class='line'>To govern him, at least to have my day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or were he only brute, I’d watch the hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make the brute-affection yield me power;</div>
      <div class='line'>But silly both and savage—O! my heart!</div>
      <div class='line'>It is too great a trial!—we must part.”—      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Oblige the savage by some act!”—“The debt,</div>
      <div class='line'>You find, the fool will instantly forget;</div>
      <div class='line'>Oblige the fool with kindness or with praise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And you the passions of the savage raise.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Time will do much.”—“Can time my name restore?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Have patience, child.”—“I am a child no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor more dependent; but, at woman’s age,</div>
      <div class='line'>I feel that wrongs provoke me and enrage.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sir, could you bring me comfort, I were cool;</div>
      <div class='line'>But keep your counsel for your boys at school.”      <span class='linenum'>410&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Doctor then departed—Why remain      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To hear complaints, who could himself complain,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who felt his actions wrong, and knew his efforts vain?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The sullen youth, contending with his fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Began the darling of his heart to hate;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her pretty looks, her auburn braid, her face,</div>
      <div class='line'>All now remain’d the proofs of his disgrace;</div>
      <div class='line'>While, more than hateful in his vixen’s eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>He saw her comforts from his griefs arise;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who felt a joy she strove not to conceal,      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When their expenses made her miser feel.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>War was perpetual: on a first attack</div>
      <div class='line'>She gain’d advantage, he would turn his back;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when her small-shot whistled in his ears,</div>
      <div class='line'>He felt a portion of his early fears;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, if he turn’d him in the battle’s heat,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fought in earnest, hers was then defeat;</div>
      <div class='line'>His strength of oath and curse brought little harm,</div>
      <div class='line'>But there was no resisting strength of arm.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet wearied both with war, and vex’d at heart,      <span class='linenum'>430&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The slaves of passion judged it best to part.</div>
      <div class='line'>Long they debated, nor could fix a rate</div>
      <div class='line'>For a man’s peace with his contending mate;</div>
      <div class='line'>But mutual hatred, scorn, and fear, assign’d</div>
      <div class='line'>That price—that peace it was not theirs to find.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The watchful husband lived in constant hope</div>
      <div class='line'>To hear the wife had ventured to elope;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, though not virtuous, nor in much discreet,</div>
      <div class='line'>He found her coldness would such views defeat;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus, by self-reproof and avarice scourged,      <span class='linenum'>440&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He wore the galling chains his folly forged.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The wife her pleasures, few and humble, sought,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with anticipated stipend bought;</div>
      <div class='line'>Without a home, at fashion’s call she fled</div>
      <div class='line'>To an hired lodging and a widow’d bed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Husband and parents banish’d from her mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>She seeks for pleasures that she cannot find;</div>
      <div class='line'>And grieves that so much treachery was employ’d</div>
      <div class='line'>To gain a man who has her peace destroy’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet more the grieving father feels distress,      <span class='linenum'>450&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His error greater, and his motives less;</div>
      <div class='line'>He finds too late, by stooping to deceit,</div>
      <div class='line'>It is ourselves and not the world we cheat;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, though we blind it, yet we can but feel</div>
      <div class='line'>That we have something evil to conceal;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor can we by our utmost care be sure</div>
      <div class='line'>That we can hide the sufferings we endure.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>T</span>he Brothers spoke of Ghosts—a favourite theme</div>
      <div class='line'>With those who love to reason or to dream;</div>
      <div class='line'>And they, as greater men were wont to do,</div>
      <div class='line'>Felt strong desire to think the stories true:</div>
      <div class='line'>Stories of spirits freed, who came to prove</div>
      <div class='line'>To spirits bound in flesh that yet they love;</div>
      <div class='line'>To give them notice of the things below,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which we must wonder how they came to know,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or known, would think of coming to relate</div>
      <div class='line'>To creatures who are tried by unknown fate.      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Warning,” said Richard, “seems the only thing</div>
      <div class='line'>That would a spirit on an errand bring;</div>
      <div class='line'>To turn a guilty mind from wrong to right</div>
      <div class='line'>A ghost might come; at least I think it might.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But,” said the Brother, “if we here are tried,</div>
      <div class='line'>A spirit sent would put that law aside;</div>
      <div class='line'>It gives to some advantage others need,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or hurts the sinner, should it not succeed.</div>

      <div class='line'>By her appearance, that engaged respect;</div>
      <div class='line'>For still she dress’d as one of higher race,</div>

      <div class='line'>“My little man,” were words that she applied</div>
      <div class='line'>To him, and he received with growing pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her darling, even from his infant years,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had something touching in his smiles and tears;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in his boyish manners he began</div>

      <div class='line'>But it became the child, the mother cried,      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line in2'>George, to his cost, though sometimes to his praise,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>The father, thoughtful of the time foregone,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Was loth to damp the spirit of his son;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Rememb’ring he himself had early laurels won;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The mother, frighten’d, begg’d him to refrain,</div>

      <div class='line'>While the kind friend so gently blamed the deed,</div>
      <div class='line'>He smiled in tears, and wish’d her to proceed;</div>
      <div class='line'>For the boy pleased her, and that roguish eye      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And daring look were cause of many a sigh,      <span class='linenum'>170}</span></div>

      <div class='line in2'>“George,” said the father, “can at pleasure seize</div>

      <div class='line'>He wastes the time that he will sigh to gain.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The partial widow thought the wasted days</div>
      <div class='line'>He would recover, urged by love and praise;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus absolved, the boy, with grateful mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Repaid a love so useful and so blind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her angry words he loved, although he fear’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And words not angry doubly kind appear’d.      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>George, then on manhood verging, felt the charms</div>
      <div class='line'>Of war, and kindled at the world’s alarms;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet war was then, though spreading wide and far,</div>
      <div class='line'>A state of peace to what has since been war:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas then some dubious claim at sea or land,</div>
      <div class='line'>That placed a weapon in a warrior’s hand;</div>
      <div class='line'>But in these times the causes of our strife</div>
      <div class='line'>Are hearth and altar, liberty and life.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>George, when from college he return’d, and heard</div>
      <div class='line'>His father’s questions, cold and shy appear’d.      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Who had the honours?”—“Honour!” said the youth,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Honour at college!—very good, in truth!”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“What hours to study did he give?”—“He gave</div>
      <div class='line'>Enough to feel they made him like a slave”—</div>
      <div class='line'>And the good vicar found, if George should rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>It would not be by college exercise.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“At least the time for your degree abide,</div>
      <div class='line'>And be ordain’d,” the man of peace replied;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Then you may come and aid me while I keep,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>And watch, and shear, the hereditary sheep;      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Choose then your spouse.”—That heard the youth, and sigh’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor to aught else attended or replied.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>George had of late indulged unusual fears</div>
      <div class='line'>And dangerous hopes; he wept unconscious tears;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether for camp or college, well he knew</div>
      <div class='line'>He must at present bid his friends adieu;</div>
      <div class='line'>His father, mother, sisters,—could he part</div>
      <div class='line'>With these, and feel no sorrow at his heart?</div>
      <div class='line'>But from that lovely lady could he go?</div>
      <div class='line'>That fonder, fairer, dearer mother?—No!      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For while his father spoke, he fix’d his eyes      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>On that dear face, and felt a warmth arise,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A trembling flush of joy, that he could ill disguise—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then ask’d himself from whence this growing bliss,</div>
      <div class='line'>This new-found joy, and all that waits on this?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why sinks that voice so sweetly in mine ear?</div>
      <div class='line'>What makes it now a livelier joy to hear?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why gives that touch—Still, still do I retain</div>
      <div class='line'>The fierce delight that tingled through each vein—</div>
      <div class='line'>Why at her presence with such quickness flows      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The vital current?—Well a lover knows.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>O! tell me not of years,—can she be old?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Those eyes, those lips, can man unmoved behold?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Has time that bosom chill’d? are cheeks so rosy cold?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>No, she is young, or I, her love t’ engage,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will grow discreet, and that will seem like age:</div>
      <div class='line'>But speak it not; Death’s equalizing arm</div>
      <div class='line'>Levels not surer than Love’s stronger charm,</div>
      <div class='line'>That bids all inequalities be gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>That laughs at rank, that mocks comparison.      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>There is not young or old, if Love decrees;</div>
      <div class='line'>He levels orders, he confounds degrees;</div>
      <div class='line'>There is not fair, or dark, or short, or tall,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or grave, or sprightly—Love reduces all;</div>
      <div class='line'>From each, abundant good a portion takes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And for each want a compensation makes;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then tell me not of years—Love, power divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Takes, as he wills, from hers, and gives to mine.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And she, in truth, was lovely—Time had strown</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>No snows on her, though he so long had flown;      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The purest damask blossom’d in her cheek;</div>
      <div class='line'>The eyes said all that eyes are wont to speak;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her pleasing person she with care adorn’d,</div>

      <div class='line'>Yet few there were who needed less the art</div>
      <div class='line'>To hide an error, or a grace impart.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>George, yet a child, her faultless form admired,</div>
      <div class='line'>And call’d his fondness love, as truth required;      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But now, when conscious of the secret flame,</div>
      <div class='line'>His bosom’s pain, he dared not give the name.</div>
      <div class='line'>In her the mother’s milder passion grew;</div>
      <div class='line'>Tender she was, but she was placid too;</div>
      <div class='line'>From him the mild and filial love was gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a strong passion came in triumph on.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Will she,” he cried, “this impious love allow?</div>
      <div class='line'>And, once my mother, be my mistress now?</div>
      <div class='line'>The parent-spouse? how far the thought from her,</div>
      <div class='line'>And how can I the daring wish aver?      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When first I speak it, how will those dear eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Gleam with awaken’d horror and surprise;</div>
      <div class='line'>Will she not, angry and indignant, fly</div>
      <div class='line'>From my imploring call, and bid me die?</div>
      <div class='line'>Will she not shudder at the thought, and say,</div>
      <div class='line'>My son! and lift her eyes to heaven and pray?</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! I fear—and yet my soul she won</div>
      <div class='line'>While she with fond endearments call’d me son!</div>
      <div class='line'>Then first I felt—yet knew that I was wrong—</div>
      <div class='line'>This hope, at once so guilty and so strong;      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She gave—I feel it now—a mother’s kiss,</div>
      <div class='line'>And quickly fancy took a bolder bliss;</div>
      <div class='line'>But hid the burning blush, for fear that eye</div>
      <div class='line'>Should see the transport, and the bliss deny.</div>
      <div class='line'>O! when she knows the purpose I conceal,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When my fond wishes to her bosom steal,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>How will the angel fear? How will the woman feel?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And yet perhaps this instant, while I speak,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Better than I she may my feelings know,      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And nurse the passion that she dares not show.</div>
      <div class='line'>She reads the look,—and sure my eyes have shown</div>

      <div class='line in21'>In fact, the youth was right;</div>
      <div class='line'>She could, but love was dreadful in her sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>Love like a spectre in her view appear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>The nearer he approach’d the more she fear’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But knew she, then, this dreaded love? She guess’d</div>
      <div class='line'>That he had guilt—she knew he had not rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>She saw a fear that she could ill define,      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And nameless terrors in his looks combine.</div>
      <div class='line'>It is a state that cannot long endure,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet both parties dreaded to be sure.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>All views were past of priesthood and a gown,</div>
      <div class='line'>George, fix’d on glory, now prepared for town;</div>
      <div class='line'>But first this mighty hazard must be run,</div>
      <div class='line'>And more than glory either lost or won:</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, what was glory? Could he win that heart</div>
      <div class='line'>And gain that hand, what cause was there to part?</div>
      <div class='line'>Her love afforded all that life affords—      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Honour and fame were phantasies and words!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But he must see her—She alone was seen</div>
      <div class='line'>In the still evening of a day serene;</div>
      <div class='line'>In the deep shade beyond the garden walk</div>
      <div class='line'>They met, and, talking, ceased and fear’d to talk.</div>
      <div class='line'>At length she spoke of parent’s love—and now</div>
      <div class='line'>He hazards all—“No parent, lady, thou!</div>
      <div class='line'>None, none to me! but looks so fond and mild</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Would well become the parent of my child.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She gasp’d for breath—then sat as one resolved      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>On some high act, and then the means revolved.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“It cannot be, my George, my child, my son!</div>
      <div class='line'>The thought is misery!—Guilt and misery shun:</div>
      <div class='line'>Far from us both be such design, O, far!</div>
      <div class='line'>Let it not pain us at the awful bar,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where souls are tried, where known the mother’s part</div>

      <div class='line'>This rebel heart, that it must not rebel?</div>
      <div class='line'>Were I not warn’d, yet Reason’s voice would cry,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Retreat, resolve, and from the danger fly!’</div>
      <div class='line'>If Reason spoke not, yet would woman’s pride</div>
      <div class='line'>A woman’s will by better counsel guide;</div>
      <div class='line'>And should both Pride and Prudence plead in vain,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There is a warning that must still remain,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, though the heart rebelled, would ever cry ‘Refrain.’”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>He heard, he grieved—so checked, the eager youth</div>
      <div class='line'>Dared not again repeat th’ offensive truth,      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But stopp’d, and fix’d on that loved face an eye</div>
      <div class='line'>Of pleading passion, trembling to reply;</div>
      <div class='line'>And that reply was hurried, was express’d</div>
      <div class='line'>With bursts of sorrow from a troubled breast;</div>
      <div class='line'>He could not yet forbear the tender suit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet dared not speak—his eloquence was mute.</div>
      <div class='line'>But though awhile in silence he supprest</div>
      <div class='line'>The pleading voice, and bade his passion rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet in each motion, in each varying look,</div>
      <div class='line'>In every tender glance, that passion spoke.—      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Words find, ere long, a passage; and once more</div>
      <div class='line'>He warmly urges what he urged before;</div>
      <div class='line'>He feels acutely, and he thinks, of course,</div>
      <div class='line'>That what he feels his language will enforce;</div>
      <div class='line'>Flame will to flame give birth, and fire to fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so from heart to heart is caught desire;</div>
      <div class='line'>He wonders how a gentle mind so long</div>
      <div class='line'>Resists the pleading of a love so strong—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“And can that heart,” he cries, “that face belie,</div>
      <div class='line'>And know no softness? Will it yet deny?”—      <span class='linenum'>380&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I tell thee, George, as I have told before,</div>
      <div class='line'>I feel a mother’s love, and feel no more;</div>
      <div class='line'>A child I bore thee in my arms, and how</div>
      <div class='line'>Could I—did prudence yield—receive thee now?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At her remonstrance hope revived, for oft</div>
      <div class='line'>He found her words severe, her accents soft;</div>
      <div class='line'>In eyes that threaten’d tears of pity stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>And truth she made as gracious as she could.—</div>
      <div class='line'>But, when she found the dangerous youth would seek</div>
      <div class='line'>His peace alone, and still his wishes speak,      <span class='linenum'>390&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Fearful she grew, that, opening thus his heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>He might to hers a dangerous warmth impart:</div>
      <div class='line'>All her objections slight to him appear’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>But one she had, and now it must be heard.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Yes, it must be! and he shall understand</div>
      <div class='line'>What powers, that are not of the world, command;</div>
      <div class='line'>So shall he cease, and I in peace shall live—”</div>
      <div class='line'>Sighing she spoke—“that widowhood can give!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then to her lover turn’d, and gravely said,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Let due attention to my words be paid:      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Meet me to-morrow, and resolve t’ obey;”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then named the hour and place, and went her way.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Before that hour, or moved by spirit vain</div>
      <div class='line'>Of woman’s wish to triumph and complain,</div>
      <div class='line'>She had his parents summon’d, and had shown</div>
      <div class='line'>Their son’s strong wishes, nor conceal’d her own:</div>
      <div class='line'>“And do you give,” she said, “a parent’s aid      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To make the youth of his strange love afraid;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, be it sin or not, be all the shame display’d.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The good old pastor wonder’d, seem’d to grieve,      <span class='linenum'>410&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And look’d suspicious on this child of Eve.</div>
      <div class='line'>He judged his boy, though wild, had never dared</div>
      <div class='line'>To talk of love, had not rebuke been spared;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he replied, in mild and tender tone,</div>
      <div class='line'>“It is not sin, and therefore shame has none.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The different ages of the pair he knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And quite as well their different fortunes too:</div>
      <div class='line'>A meek, just man; but difference in his sight</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>That made the match unequal made it right.</div>
      <div class='line'>“His son, his friend united, and become      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of his own hearth—the comforts of his home—</div>
      <div class='line'>Was it so wrong? Perhaps it was her pride</div>
      <div class='line'>That felt the distance, and the youth denied?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The blushing widow heard, and she retired,</div>
      <div class='line'>Musing on what her ancient friend desired;</div>
      <div class='line'>She could not, therefore, to the youth complain,</div>
      <div class='line'>That his good father wish’d him to refrain;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Now, in th’ appointed minute met the pair,      <span class='linenum'>430&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Foredoom’d to meet: George made the lover’s prayer—</div>
      <div class='line'>That was heard kindly; then the lady tried</div>
      <div class='line'>For a calm spirit, felt it, and replied.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“George, that I love thee why should I suppress?</div>
      <div class='line'>For ’tis a love that virtue may profess—</div>
      <div class='line'>Parental—frown not—tender, fix’d, sincere;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Thou art for dearer ties by much too dear,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And nearer must not be, thou art so very near.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, do not reason, prudence, pride agree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our very feelings, that it must not be?      <span class='linenum'>440&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, look not so, I shun the task no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>But will to thee thy better self restore.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Then hear, and hope not; to the tale I tell</div>
      <div class='line'>Attend! obey me, and let all be well.</div>
      <div class='line'>Love is forbad to me, and thou wilt find</div>
      <div class='line'>All thy too ardent views must be resign’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then from thy bosom all such thoughts remove,</div>
      <div class='line'>And spare the curse of interdicted love.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“If doubts at first assail thee, wait awhile,</div>

      <div class='line'>For, if not much of other worlds we know,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor how a spirit speaks in this below,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still there is speech and intercourse; and now      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The truth of what I tell I first avow:      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'>By the one holy Three, by the thrice holy One,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I saw my brother—saw him by my bed,</div>

      <div class='line'>Increase of anguish shall new years bestow,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Pain shall on thought and grief on reason grow,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line in2'>“‘A second marriage!—No!—by all that’s dear!’</div>

      <div class='line'>Distinctly cannot, but thy will is free.</div>
      <div class='line'>Come, weep not, sister—spirits can but guess,</div>

      <div class='line'>For who would rashly venture on a snare?’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘I swear!’ I answer’d.—‘No, thou must not swear,’</div>
      <div class='line'>He said, or I had sworn; but still the vow</div>
      <div class='line'>Was past, was in my mind, and there is now:</div>

      <div class='line'>I smiled before, but I am angry now.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thee will they bind by threats, and thou wilt shake</div>

      <div class='line'>Have I not seen him, left he not a sign?</div>
      <div class='line'>Did I not then the placid features trace</div>

      <div class='line'>And then my father—but how different seem</div>
      <div class='line'>These visitations—this, indeed, a dream!      <span class='linenum'>690&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line in2'>“On the fourth day came letters, and I cried,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>‘Richard is dead,’ and named the day he died:      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A proof of knowledge, true! but one, alas! of pride.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'>She the predicted fortune will pursue,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'>The strong temptation to her thought applied</div>
      <div class='line'>Will gain new strength, and will not be denied;</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>With vows to virtue weakness will begin,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fears of sinning let in thoughts of sin.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Strong in her sense of weakness, now withdrew</div>
      <div class='line'>The cautious lady from the lover’s view;      <span class='linenum'>740&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But she perceived the looks of all were changed—</div>
      <div class='line'>Her kind old friends grew peevish and estranged;</div>
      <div class='line'>A fretful spirit reign’d, and discontent</div>
      <div class='line'>From room to room in sullen silence went;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the kind widow was distress’d at heart</div>
      <div class='line'>To think that she no comfort could impart:</div>
      <div class='line'>“But he will go,” she said, “and he will strive</div>
      <div class='line'>In fields of glorious energy to drive</div>
      <div class='line'>Love from his bosom—Yes, I then may stay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all will thank me on a future day.”      <span class='linenum'>750&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>So judged the lady, nor appear’d to grieve,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the young soldier came to take his leave;</div>
      <div class='line'>But not of all assembled—No! he found</div>
      <div class='line'>His gentle sisters all in sorrow drown’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>With many a shaken hand, and many a kiss,</div>
      <div class='line'>He cried, “Farewell! a solemn business this;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, Susan, Sophy!—heaven and earth, my dears!</div>
      <div class='line'>I am a soldier—What do I with tears?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He sought his parents;—they together walk’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And of their son, his views and dangers, talk’d;      <span class='linenum'>760&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They knew not how to blame their friend, but still</div>
      <div class='line'>They murmur’d, “She may save us if she will;</div>
      <div class='line'>Were not these visions working in her mind</div>
      <div class='line'>Strange things—’tis in her nature to be kind.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Their son appear’d—He sooth’d them, and was bless’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>But still the fondness of his soul confess’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>And where the lady?—To her room retired!</div>
      <div class='line'>Now show, dear son, the courage she required.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>George bow’d in silence, trying for assent</div>
      <div class='line'>To his hard fate, and to his trial went:      <span class='linenum'>770&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Fond, but yet fix’d, he found her in her room;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Firm, and yet fearful, she beheld him come;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor sought he favour now—No! he would meet his doom.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'>Your frequent talk of dreams has made me turn</div>

      <div class='line'>Walk’d and conversed with labourers at the plough;</div>

      <div class='line'>With woodmen resting o’er the enlivening flask;</div>
      <div class='line'>And with the shepherd, watchful of his fold</div>

      <div class='line'>Further afield he sometimes would proceed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And take a path, wherever it might lead.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It led him far about to Wickham Green,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where stood the mansion of the village queen;      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>Full many years she could, no question, tell,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>To wait her season, and to take her turn.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Their husbands maids as priests their livings gain:</div>

      <div class='line'>And thus they wait, till many years are past,</div>
      <div class='line'>For what comes slowly—<i>but it comes at last</i>.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Harriet was wedded,—but it must be said,</div>
      <div class='line'>The vow’d obedience was not duly paid.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hers was an easy man—it gave him pain</div>
      <div class='line'>To hear a lady murmur and complain;</div>
      <div class='line'>He was a merchant, whom his father made      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Rich in the gains of a successful trade;</div>
      <div class='line'>A lot more pleasant, or a view more fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Has seldom fallen to a youthful pair.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But what is faultless in a world like this?</div>
      <div class='line'>In every station something seems amiss.</div>
      <div class='line'>The lady, married, found the house too small—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Two shabby parlours, and that ugly hall!</div>
      <div class='line'>Had we a cottage somewhere, and could meet</div>
      <div class='line'>One’s friends and favourites in one’s snug retreat;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or only join a single room to these,      <span class='linenum'>90}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It would be living something at our ease,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And have one’s self, at home, the comfort that one sees.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such powers of reason, and of mind such strength,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fought with man’s fear, and they prevail’d at length.</div>
      <div class='line'>The room was built—and Harriet did not know</div>
      <div class='line'>A prettier dwelling, either high or low;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Harriet loved such conquests, loved to plead</div>
      <div class='line'>With her reluctant man, and to succeed;</div>
      <div class='line'>It was such pleasure to prevail o’er one      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who would oppose the thing that still was done;      <span class='linenum'>100}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who never gain’d the race, but yet would groan and run.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But there were times when love and pity gave</div>
      <div class='line'>Whatever thoughtless vanity could crave.</div>
      <div class='line'>She now the carriage chose with freshest name,</div>
      <div class='line'>And was in quite a fever till it came;</div>
      <div class='line'>But can a carriage be alone enjoy’d?</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The pleasure not partaken is destroy’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>“I must have some good creature to attend</div>
      <div class='line'>On morning visits as a kind of friend.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A courteous maiden then was found to sit      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Beside the lady, for her purpose fit:</div>
      <div class='line'>Who had been train’d in all the soothing ways</div>
      <div class='line'>And servile duties from her early days;</div>
      <div class='line'>One who had never from her childhood known</div>
      <div class='line'>A wish fulfill’d, a purpose of her own.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her part it was to sit beside the dame,</div>
      <div class='line'>And give relief in every want that came;</div>
      <div class='line'>To soothe the pride, to watch the varying look,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bow in silence to the dumb rebuke.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This supple being strove with all her skill      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To draw her master’s to her lady’s will;</div>
      <div class='line'>For they were like the magnet and the steel,</div>
      <div class='line'>At times so distant that they could not feel.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then would she gently move them, till she saw</div>
      <div class='line'>That to each other they began to draw;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then would leave them, sure on her return</div>
      <div class='line'>In Harriet’s joy her conquest to discern.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She was a mother now, and grieved to find</div>
      <div class='line'>The nursery window caught the eastern wind;</div>
      <div class='line'>What could she do, with fears like these oppress’d?      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She built a room all window’d to the west;</div>
      <div class='line'>For sure in one so dull, so bleak, so old,</div>
      <div class='line'>She and her children must expire with cold.</div>
      <div class='line'>Meantime the husband murmur’d—“So he might;</div>
      <div class='line'>She would be judged by Cousins—Was it right?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Water was near them, and her mind afloat;</div>
      <div class='line'>The lady saw a cottage and a boat,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thought what sweet excursions they might make;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>How they might sail; what neighbours they might take;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And nicely would she deck the lodge upon the lake.      <span class='linenum'>140}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>She now prevail’d by habit; had her will,</div>
      <div class='line'>And found her patient husband sad and still.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet this displeased; she gain’d, indeed, the prize,</div>
      <div class='line'>But not the pleasure of her victories;</div>
      <div class='line'>Was she a child to be indulged? He knew</div>
      <div class='line'>She would have right, but would have reason too.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Now came the time, when in her husband’s face</div>
      <div class='line'>Care, and concern, and caution she could trace;</div>
      <div class='line'>His troubled features gloom and sadness bore;</div>
      <div class='line'>Less he resisted, but he suffer’d more;      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His nerves were shook like hers; in him her grief</div>
      <div class='line'>Had much of sympathy, but no relief.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She could no longer read, and therefore kept</div>
      <div class='line'>A girl to give her stories while she wept;</div>
      <div class='line'>Better for Lady Julia’s woes to cry,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than have her own for ever in her eye.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her husband grieved; and o’er his spirits came</div>
      <div class='line'>Gloom, and disease attack’d his slender frame;</div>
      <div class='line'>He felt a loathing for the wretched state</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his concerns, so sad, so complicate;      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Grief and confusion seized him in the day,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the night pass’d in agony away.</div>
      <div class='line'>“My ruin comes!” was his awakening thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>And vainly through the day was comfort sought;</div>
      <div class='line'>“There, take my all!” he said, and in his dream</div>
      <div class='line'>Heard the door bolted, and his children scream.</div>
      <div class='line'>And he was right, for not a day arose</div>
      <div class='line'>That he exclaim’d not, “Will it never close?”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Would it were come!”—but still he shifted on,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till health, and hope, and life’s fair views were gone.      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Fretful herself, he of his wife in vain</div>
      <div class='line'>For comfort sought—“He would be well again;</div>
      <div class='line'>Time would disorders of such nature heal!</div>
      <div class='line'>O! if he felt what she was doom’d to feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such sleepless nights! such broken rest! her frame</div>
      <div class='line'>Rack’d with diseases that she could not name!</div>
      <div class='line'>With pangs like hers no other was oppress’d!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Weeping, she said, and sigh’d herself to rest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The suffering husband look’d the world around,</div>
      <div class='line'>And saw no friend: on him misfortune frown’d;      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Him self-reproach tormented; sorely tried</div>
      <div class='line'>By threats, he mourn’d, and by disease, he died.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As weak as wailing infancy or age,</div>
      <div class='line'>How could the widow with the world engage?</div>
      <div class='line'>Fortune not now the means of comfort gave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet all her comforts Harriet wept to have.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“My helpless babes,” she said, “will nothing know,”</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet not a single lesson would bestow;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her debts would overwhelm her, that was sure,</div>
      <div class='line'>But one privation would she not endure.      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“We shall want bread! the thing is past a doubt.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Then part with Cousins!”—“Can I do without?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Dismiss your servants!”—“Spare me them, I pray!”-</div>
      <div class='line'>“At least your carriage!”—“What will people say?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“That useless boat, that folly on the lake!”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“O! but what cry and scandal will it make!”</div>
      <div class='line'>It was so hard on her, who not a thing</div>
      <div class='line'>Had done such mischief on their heads to bring;</div>
      <div class='line'>This was her comfort, this she would declare;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then slept soundly on her pillow’d chair.      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When not asleep, how restless was the soul</div>
      <div class='line'>Above advice, exempted from control;</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever begging all to be sincere,</div>
      <div class='line'>And never willing any truth to hear.</div>
      <div class='line'>A yellow paleness o’er her visage spread;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her fears augmented as her comforts fled;</div>
      <div class='line'>Views dark and dismal to her mind appear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>And death she sometimes woo’d, and always fear’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Among the clerks there was a thoughtful one,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who still believed that something might be done;      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>All in his view was not so sunk and lost,</div>
      <div class='line'>But of a trial things would pay the cost.</div>
      <div class='line'>He judged the widow, and he saw the way</div>
      <div class='line'>In which her husband suffer’d her to stray;</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw entangled and perplex’d affairs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Time’s sure hand at work on their repairs;</div>
      <div class='line'>Children he saw; but nothing could he see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Why he might not their careful father be;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, looking keenly round him, he believed</div>
      <div class='line'>That what was lost might quickly be retrieved.      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now thought our clerk—“I must not mention love:</div>
      <div class='line'>That she at least must seem to disapprove;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I must fear of poverty enforce,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then consent will be a thing of course.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Madam!” said he, “with sorrow I relate,</div>
      <div class='line'>That our affairs are in a dreadful state;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>I call’d on all our friends, and they declared</div>
      <div class='line'>They dared not meddle—not a creature dared;</div>
      <div class='line'>But still our perseverance chance may aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, though I’m puzzled, I am not afraid;      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>If you, dear lady, will attention give</div>
      <div class='line'>To me, the credit of the house shall live;</div>
      <div class='line'>Do not, I pray you, my proposal blame;</div>
      <div class='line'>It is my wish to guard your husband’s fame,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ease your trouble: then, your cares resign</div>
      <div class='line'>To my discretion—and, in short, be mine.”—</div>
      <div class='line in3'>“Yours! O! my stars!—Your goodness, sir, deserves</div>
      <div class='line'>My grateful thanks—take pity on my nerves;</div>
      <div class='line'>I shake and tremble at a thing so new,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fear ’tis what a lady should not do;      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And then to marry upon ruin’s brink</div>
      <div class='line'>In all this hurry—What will people think?”—</div>
      <div class='line in3'>“Nay, there’s against us neither rule nor law,</div>
      <div class='line'>And people’s thinking is not worth a straw.</div>
      <div class='line'>Those who are prudent have too much to do</div>
      <div class='line'>With their own cares to think of me and you;</div>
      <div class='line'>And those who are not are so poor a race,</div>
      <div class='line'>That what they utter can be no disgrace.—</div>
      <div class='line'>Come! let us now embark; when time and tide</div>
      <div class='line'>Invite to sea, in happy hour decide;      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>If yet we linger, both are sure to fail,</div>
      <div class='line'>The turning waters and the varying gale.</div>
      <div class='line'>Trust me, our vessel shall be ably steer’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor will I quit her, till the rocks are clear’d.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Allured and frighten’d, soften’d and afraid,</div>
      <div class='line'>The widow doubted, ponder’d, and obey’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>So were they wedded, and the careful man</div>
      <div class='line'>His reformation instantly began;</div>
      <div class='line'>Began his state with vigour to reform,</div>
      <div class='line'>And made a calm by laughing at the storm.      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in3'>Th’ attendant-maiden he dismiss’d—for why?</div>
      <div class='line'>She might on him and love like his rely;</div>
      <div class='line'>She needed none to form her children’s mind—</div>
      <div class='line'>That duty nature to her care assign’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>In vain she mourn’d, it was her health he prized,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hence enforced the measures he advised;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>She wanted air; and walking, she was told,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was safe, was pleasant!—he the carriage sold;</div>
      <div class='line'>He found a tenant who agreed to take</div>
      <div class='line'>The boat and cottage on the useless lake;      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The house itself had now superfluous room,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a rich lodger was induced to come.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The lady wonder’d at the sudden change,</div>
      <div class='line'>That yet was pleasant, that was very strange.</div>
      <div class='line'>When every deed by her desire was done.</div>
      <div class='line'>She had no day of comfort—no, not one;</div>
      <div class='line'>When nothing moved or stopp’d at her request,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her heart had comfort, and her temper rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>For all was done with kindness—most polite</div>
      <div class='line'>Was her new lord, and she confess’d it right;      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For now she found that she could gaily live</div>
      <div class='line'>On what the chance of common life could give:</div>
      <div class='line'>And her sick mind was cured of every ill,</div>
      <div class='line'>By finding no compliance with her will;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, when she saw that her desires were vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>She wisely thought it foolish to complain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Born for her man, she gave a gentle sigh</div>
      <div class='line'>To her lost power, and grieved not to comply;</div>
      <div class='line'>Within, without, the face of things improved,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all in order and subjection moved.      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>As wealth increased, ambition now began</div>
      <div class='line'>To swell the soul of the aspiring man.</div>
      <div class='line'>In some few years he thought to purchase land,</div>
      <div class='line'>And build a seat that Hope and Fancy plann’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>To this a name his youthful bride should give!</div>
      <div class='line'>Harriet, of course, not many years would live;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then he would farm, and every soil should show</div>
      <div class='line'>The tree that best upon the place would grow:</div>
      <div class='line'>He would, moreover, on the Bench debate</div>
      <div class='line'>On sundry questions—when a magistrate;      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Would talk of all that to the state belongs,</div>
      <div class='line'>The rich man’s duties, and the poor man’s wrongs;</div>
      <div class='line'>He would with favourites of the people rank,</div>
      <div class='line'>And him the weak and the oppress’d should thank.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>’Tis true those children, orphans then! would need</div>
      <div class='line'>Help, in a world of trouble to succeed!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>And they should have it—He should then possess</div>
      <div class='line'>All that man needs for earthly happiness.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Proud words, and vain!” said Doctor Young; and proud</div>
      <div class='line'>They are; and vain were by our clerk allow’d;      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For, while he dream’d, there came both pain and cough,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fever never tamed, and bore him off;</div>
      <div class='line'>Young as he was, and planning schemes to live</div>
      <div class='line'>With more delight than man’s success can give;</div>
      <div class='line'>Building a mansion in his fancy vast,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beyond the Gothic pride of ages past!</div>
      <div class='line'>While this was plann’d, but ere a place was sought,</div>
      <div class='line'>The timber season’d, or the quarry wrought,</div>
      <div class='line'>Came Death’s dread summons; and the man was laid</div>
      <div class='line'>In the poor house the simple sexton made.      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But he had time for thought when he was ill,</div>
      <div class='line'>And made his lady an indulgent will:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis said he gave, in parting, his advice,</div>
      <div class='line'>“It is sufficient to be married twice;”</div>
      <div class='line'>To which she answer’d, as ’tis said, again,</div>
      <div class='line'>“There’s none will have you, if you’re poor and plain;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if you’re rich and handsome, there is none</div>
      <div class='line'>Will take refusal—let the point alone.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Be this or true or false, it is her praise</div>
      <div class='line'>She mourn’d correctly all the mourning days;      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But grieve she did not, for the canker grief</div>
      <div class='line'>Soils the complexion, and is beauty’s thief.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nothing, indeed, so much will discompose</div>
      <div class='line'>Our public mourning as our private woes;</div>
      <div class='line'>When tender thoughts a widow’s bosom probe,</div>
      <div class='line'>She thinks not then how graceful sits the robe;</div>
      <div class='line'>But our nice widow look’d to every fold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every eye its beauty might behold!</div>
      <div class='line'>It was becoming; she composed her face,</div>
      <div class='line'>She look’d serenely, and she mourn’d with grace.      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Some months were pass’d; but yet there wanted three</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the full time when widows wives may be—</div>
      <div class='line'>One trying year, and then the mind is freed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And man may to the vacant throne succeed.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There was a tenant—he, to wit, who hired</div>
      <div class='line'>That cot and lake, that were so much admired;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>A man of spirit, one who doubtless meant,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though he delay’d awhile, to pay his rent;</div>
      <div class='line'>The widow’s riches gave her much delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And some her claims; and she resolved to write.      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“He knew her grievous loss, how every care</div>
      <div class='line'>Devolved on her, who had indeed her share;</div>
      <div class='line'>She had no doubt of him—but was as sure</div>
      <div class='line'>As that she breathed her money was secure;</div>
      <div class='line'>But she had made a rash and idle vow</div>
      <div class='line'>To claim her dues, and she must keep it now.</div>
      <div class='line'>So, if it suited——”</div>
      <div class='line in22'>And for this there came</div>
      <div class='line'>A civil answer to the gentle dame.</div>
      <div class='line'>Within the letter were excuses, thanks,</div>
      <div class='line'>And clean Bank paper from the best of banks;      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There were condolence, consolation, praise,</div>
      <div class='line'>With some slight hints of danger in delays.</div>
      <div class='line'>With these good things were others from the lake:      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Perch that were wish’d to salmon for her sake,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And compliment as sweet as new-born hope could make.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>This led to friendly visits, social calls,</div>
      <div class='line'>And much discourse of races, rambles, balls;</div>
      <div class='line'>But all in proper bounds, and not a word</div>
      <div class='line'>Before its time—the man was not absurd,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor was he cold; but, when she might expect,      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A letter came, and one to this effect:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“That, if his eyes had not his love convey’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>They had their master shamefully betray’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>But she must know the flame, that he was sure,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor she could doubt, would long as life endure.</div>
      <div class='line'>Both were in widow’d state, and both possess’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Of ample means to make their union bless’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>That she had been confined he knew for truth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And begg’d her to have pity on her youth;</div>
      <div class='line'>Youth, he would say, and he desired his wife      <span class='linenum'>380&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To have the comforts of an easy life.</div>
      <div class='line'>She loved a carriage, loved a decent seat</div>
      <div class='line'>To which they might at certain times retreat;</div>
      <div class='line'>Servants indeed were sorrows—yet a few</div>
      <div class='line'>They still must add, and do as others do;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>She too would some attendant damsel need,</div>
      <div class='line'>To hear, to speak, to travel, or to read.”</div>
      <div class='line'>In short, the man his remedies assign’d</div>
      <div class='line'>For his foreknown diseases in the mind:—</div>
      <div class='line'>“First,” he presumed, “that in a nervous case      <span class='linenum'>390&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nothing was better than a change of place;”</div>
      <div class='line'>He added, too, “’Twas well that he could prove</div>
      <div class='line'>That his was pure, disinterested love;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not as when lawyers couple house and land</div>
      <div class='line'>In such a way as none can understand:</div>
      <div class='line'>No! thanks to Him that every good supplied,</div>
      <div class='line'>He had enough, and wanted nought beside!</div>
      <div class='line'>Merit was all.”</div>
      <div class='line in16'>“Well! now, she would protest,</div>
      <div class='line'>This was a letter prettily express’d.”</div>
      <div class='line'>To every female friend away she flew      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To ask advice, and say, “What shall I do?”</div>
      <div class='line'>She kiss’d her children—and she said, with tears,</div>
      <div class='line'>“I wonder what is best for you, my dears?</div>
      <div class='line'>How can I, darlings, to your good attend      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Without the help of some experienced friend,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who will protect us all, or, injured, will defend?”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The widow then ask’d counsel of her heart—</div>
      <div class='line'>In vain, for that had nothing to impart;</div>
      <div class='line'>But yet with that, or something, for her guide,</div>
      <div class='line'>She to her swain thus guardedly replied:      <span class='linenum'>410&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“She must believe he was sincere, for why</div>
      <div class='line'>Should one who needed nothing deign to lie?</div>
      <div class='line'>But though she could and did his truth admit,</div>
      <div class='line'>She could not praise him for his taste a bit;</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet men’s tastes were various, she confess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And none could prove his own to be the best;</div>
      <div class='line'>It was a vast concern, including all</div>
      <div class='line'>That we can happiness or comfort call;</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet she found that those who waited long</div>
      <div class='line'>Before their choice, had often chosen wrong.      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nothing, indeed, could for her loss atone,</div>
      <div class='line'>But ’twas the greater that she lived alone;</div>
      <div class='line'>She, too, had means, and therefore what the use</div>
      <div class='line'>Of more, that still more trouble would produce?</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>And pleasure too she own’d, as well as care,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of which, at present, she had not her share.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“The things he offer’d, she must needs confess,</div>
      <div class='line'>They were all women’s wishes, more or less;</div>
      <div class='line'>But were expensive—though a man of sense</div>
      <div class='line'>Would by his prudence lighten the expense.      <span class='linenum'>430&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Prudent he was, but made a sad mistake</div>
      <div class='line'>When he proposed her faded face to take;</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet ’tis said there’s beauty that will last</div>
      <div class='line'>When the rose withers and the bloom be past.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“One thing displeased her—that he could suppose</div>
      <div class='line'>He might so soon his purposes disclose;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet had she hints of such intent before,</div>
      <div class='line'>And would excuse him if he wrote no more.</div>
      <div class='line'>What would the world—and yet she judged them fools</div>
      <div class='line'>Who let the world’s suggestions be their rules;      <span class='linenum'>440&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What would her friends—Yet in her own affairs</div>
      <div class='line'>It was her business to decide, not theirs.—</div>
      <div class='line'>Adieu! then, sir,” she added; “thus you find      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The changeless purpose of a steady mind,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In one now left alone, but to her fate resign’d.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The marriage follow’d; and th’ experienced dame</div>
      <div class='line'>Consider’d what the conduct that became</div>
      <div class='line'>A thrice-devoted lady—She confess’d</div>
      <div class='line'>That when indulged she was but more distress’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, by her second husband when controll’d,      <span class='linenum'>450&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her life was pleasant, though her love was cold;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Then let me yield,” she said, and with a sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Let me to wrong submit, with right comply.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Alas! obedience may mistake, and they</div>
      <div class='line'>Who reason not will err when they obey;</div>
      <div class='line'>And fated was the gentle dame to find</div>
      <div class='line'>Her duty wrong, and her obedience blind.</div>
      <div class='line'>The man was kind, but would have no dispute,</div>
      <div class='line'>His love and kindness both were absolute.</div>
      <div class='line'>She needed not her wishes to express      <span class='linenum'>460&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To one who urged her on to happiness;</div>
      <div class='line'>For this he took her to the lakes and seas,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To mines and mountains, nor allow’d her ease;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She must be pleased, he said, and he must live to please.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>He hurried north and south, and east and west,</div>
      <div class='line'>When age required they would have time to rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>He in the richest dress her form array’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cared not what he promised, what he paid;</div>
      <div class='line'>She should share all his pleasures as her own,</div>
      <div class='line'>And see whatever could be sought or shown.      <span class='linenum'>470&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>This run of pleasure for a time she bore,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then affirm’d that she could taste no more;</div>
      <div class='line'>She loved it while its nature it retain’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, made a duty, it displeased and pain’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Have we not means?” the joyous husband cried;</div>
      <div class='line'>“But I am wearied out,” the wife replied.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Wearied with pleasure! Thing till now unheard—</div>
      <div class='line'>Are all that sweeten trouble to be fear’d?</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis but the sameness tires you—cross the seas,</div>
      <div class='line'>And let us taste the world’s varieties.      <span class='linenum'>480&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“’Tis said, in Paris that a man may live</div>
      <div class='line'>In all the luxuries a world can give;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in a space confined to narrow bound</div>
      <div class='line'>All the enjoyments of our life are found.</div>
      <div class='line'>There we may eat and drink, may dance and dress,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in its very essence joy possess;</div>
      <div class='line'>May see a moving crowd of lovely dames;</div>
      <div class='line'>May win a fortune at your favourite games;</div>
      <div class='line'>May hear the sounds that ravish human sense,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all without receding foot from thence.”      <span class='linenum'>490&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The conquer’d wife, resistless and afraid,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the strong call a sad obedience paid.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As we an infant in its pain with sweets,</div>
      <div class='line'>Loved once, now loath’d, torment him till he eats,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who on the authors of his new distress</div>
      <div class='line'>Looks trembling with disgusted weariness:</div>
      <div class='line'>So Harriet felt, so look’d, and seem’d to say,</div>
      <div class='line'>“O! for a day of rest, an holiday!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At length, her courage rising with her fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>She said, “Our pleasures may be bought too dear!”      <span class='linenum'>500&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>To this he answer’d—“Dearest! from thy heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Bid every fear of evil times depart;</div>
      <div class='line'>I ever trusted in the trying hour</div>
      <div class='line'>To my good stars, and felt the ruling power;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>When want drew nigh, his threat’ning speed was stopp’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some virgin aunt, some childless uncle dropped;</div>
      <div class='line'>In all his threats I sought expedients new,</div>
      <div class='line'>And my last, best resource was found in you.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Silent and sad the wife beheld her doom,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sat her down to see the ruin come,      <span class='linenum'>510&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And meet the ills that rise where money fails—</div>
      <div class='line'>Debts, threats and duns, bills, bailiffs, writs and jails.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>These was she spared; ere yet by want oppress’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Came one more fierce than bailiff in arrest:</div>
      <div class='line'>Amid a scene where Pleasure never came,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though never ceased the mention of his name,</div>
      <div class='line'>The husband’s heated blood received the breath</div>
      <div class='line'>Of strong disease, that bore him to his death.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her all collected,—whether great or small</div>
      <div class='line'>The sum, I know not, but collected all—      <span class='linenum'>520&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The widow’d lady to her cot retired,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there she lives delighted and admired.</div>
      <div class='line'>Civil to all, compliant and polite,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Disposed to think, “whatever is, is right,”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She wears the widow’s weeds, she gives the widow’s mite.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At home awhile, she in the autumn finds</div>
      <div class='line'>The sea an object for reflecting minds,</div>
      <div class='line'>And change for tender spirits; there she reads,</div>
      <div class='line'>And weeps in comfort in her graceful weeds.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>What gives our tale its moral? Here we find      <span class='linenum'>530&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That wives like this are not for rule design’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor yet for blind submission: happy they,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who while they feel it pleasant to obey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have yet a kind companion at their side      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who in their journey will his power divide,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or yield the reins, and bid the lady guide;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then points the wonders of the way, and makes</div>
      <div class='line'>The duty pleasant that she undertakes;</div>
      <div class='line'>He shows her objects as they move along,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gently rules the movements that are wrong:      <span class='linenum'>540&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He tells her all the skilful driver’s art,</div>
      <div class='line'>And smiles to see how well she acts her part;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor praise denies to courage or to skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>In using power that he resumes at will.</div>

      <div class='line'>“I must depart!”—“That, Brother, I deny,”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Said George—“You may; but I perceive not why.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>This point before had been discuss’d, but still</div>
      <div class='line'>The guest submitted to the ruling will;</div>
      <div class='line'>But every day gave rise to doubt and fear—</div>
      <div class='line'>He heard not now, as he was wont to hear,</div>
      <div class='line'>That all was well!—though little was cxpress’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>It seem’d to him the writer was distress’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Restrain’d! there was attempt and strife to please,      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Pains and endeavour—not Matilda’s ease—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not the pure lines of love! the guileless friend</div>
      <div class='line'>In all her freedom—What could this portend?</div>
      <div class='line'>“Fancy!” said George, “the self-tormentor’s pain”;—</div>
      <div class='line'>And Richard still consented to remain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Ride you this fair cool morning?” said the squire:      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Do—for a purchase I have made inquire,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And with you take a will complacently t’admire:      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Southward at first, dear Richard, make your way;</div>
      <div class='line'>Cross Hilton Bridge; move on through Breken Clay;      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At Dunham Wood turn duly to the east,</div>

      <div class='line'>A decent house; an ample garden too,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And planted well behind—a lively scene, and new:      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A little taste, a little pomp, display’d      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>By a dull man, who had retired from trade</div>

      <div class='line'>Of crops in courses raised, of herds by matching bred.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>We had just found these little humours out;</div>
      <div class='line'>Just saw—he saw not—what he was about;</div>
      <div class='line'>Just met as neighbours, still disposed to meet;</div>
      <div class='line'>Just learn’d the current tales of Dowling Street;      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And were just thinking of our female friends,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>“But hear me, Richard: looking to my ease,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>“Mark well the rooms, and their proportions learn;</div>
      <div class='line'>In each some use, some elegance discern;</div>
      <div class='line'>Observe the garden, its productive wall,</div>
      <div class='line'>And find a something to commend in all.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, should you praise them in a knowing way,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll take it kindly—that is well—be gay.      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Nor pass the pebbled cottage as you rise</div>
      <div class='line'>Above the sluice, till you have fix’d your eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>On the low woodbined window, and have seen,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Richard return’d, and by his Brother stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not in a pensive, not in pleasant mood;</div>
      <div class='line'>But by strong feeling into stillness wrought,</div>
      <div class='line'>As nothing thinking, or with too much thought;      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>Or what confess?”—“Who is she?” he replied,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That angel whom I saw, to whom is she allied?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of this fair being let me understand,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>“Hers was that cottage on the rising ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>West of the waves, and just beyond their sound;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis larger than the rest, and whence, indeed,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>You might expect a lady to proceed;</div>
      <div class='line'>But O! this creature, far as I could trace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will soon be carried to another place.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘Fair, fragile thing!’ I said, when first my eye</div>

      <div class='line'>Or wilt thou vanish? beauteous spirit, stay!—</div>
      <div class='line'>For will it not’ (I question’d) ‘melt away?’</div>
      <div class='line'>No! it was mortal—I unseen was near,</div>

      <div class='line'>And first she read, then laid aside her book;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>She was an only daughter, one whose sire</div>
      <div class='line'>Loved not that girls to knowledge should aspire;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he had sons, and Ellen quickly caught</div>
      <div class='line'>Whatever they were by their masters taught;</div>
      <div class='line'>This when the father saw—“It is the turn</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her strange mind,” said he, “but let her learn;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis almost pity with that shape and face—</div>

      <div class='line'>Women of old wrote verse, or for the stage      <span class='linenum'>120}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Brought forth their works! they now are reasoners sage,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And with severe pursuits dare grapple and engage.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>If such her mind, I shall in vain oppose;</div>
      <div class='line'>If not, her labours of themselves will close.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ellen, ’twas found, had skill without pretence,</div>
      <div class='line'>And silenced envy by her meek good sense;</div>
      <div class='line'>That Ellen learnt, her various knowledge proved;</div>
      <div class='line'>Soft words and tender looks, that Ellen loved;</div>
      <div class='line'>For he who taught her brothers found in her</div>
      <div class='line'>A constant, ready, eager auditor;      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>This he perceived, nor could his joy disguise:</div>
      <div class='line'>It tuned his voice, it sparkled in his eyes.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Not very young, nor very handsome he,</div>
      <div class='line'>But very fit an Abelard to be;</div>
      <div class='line'>His manner and his meekness hush’d alarm</div>
      <div class='line'>In all but Ellen—Ellen felt the charm.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hers was fond “filial love”; she found delight</div>
      <div class='line'>To have her mind’s dear father in her sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>But soon the borrow’d notion she resign’d!</div>
      <div class='line'>He was no father—even to the mind.      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>But Ellen had her comforts—“He will speak,”</div>
      <div class='line'>She said, “for he beholds me fond and weak;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fond, and he therefore may securely plead—</div>
      <div class='line'>Weak, I have therefore of his firmness need;</div>
      <div class='line'>With whom my father will his Ellen trust,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because he knows him to be kind and just.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Alas! too well the conscious lover knew</div>
      <div class='line'>The parent’s mind, and well the daughter’s too;</div>
      <div class='line'>He felt of duty the imperious call,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beheld his danger, and must fly or fall.      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What would the parent, what his pupils think?</div>
      <div class='line'>O! he was standing on perdition’s brink:</div>
      <div class='line'>In his dilemma flight alone remain’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And could he fly whose very soul was chain’d?</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew she loved; she tried not to conceal</div>
      <div class='line'>A hope she thought that virtue’s self might feel.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ever of her and her frank heart afraid,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Doubting himself, he sought in absence aid,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And had resolved on flight, but still the act delay’d;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At last so high his apprehension rose,      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That he would both his love and labour close.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“While undisclosed my fear each instant grows,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I lament the guilt that no one knows:</div>
      <div class='line'>Success undoes me, and the view, that cheers</div>
      <div class='line'>All other men, all dark to me appears!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus as he thought, his Ellen at his side</div>
      <div class='line'>Her soothing softness to his grief applied;</div>
      <div class='line'>With like effect as water cast on flame:</div>
      <div class='line'>For he more heated and confused became,</div>
      <div class='line'>And broke in sorrow from the wondering maid,      <span class='linenum'>170}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who was at once offended and afraid;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet “Do not go!” she cried, and was awhile obey’d.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Art thou then ill, dear friend?” she ask’d, and took</div>
      <div class='line'>His passive hand—“How very pale thy look!</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou art cold, and tremblest—pray thee tell</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy friend, thy Ellen, is her master well?</div>
      <div class='line'>And let her with her loving care attend</div>
      <div class='line'>To all that vexes and disturbs her friend.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Nay, my dear lady! we have all our cares,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I am troubled with my poor affairs:      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Thou canst not aid me, Ellen; could it be,</div>
      <div class='line'>And might it, doubtless I would fly to thee;</div>
      <div class='line'>But we have sundry duties, and must all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hard as it may be, go where duties call—</div>
      <div class='line'>Suppose the trial were this instant thine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Couldst thou the happiest of thy views resign</div>
      <div class='line'>At duty’s strong command?”—“If thou wert by,”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Said the unconscious maiden, “I would try!”—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And as she sigh’d she heard the soft responsive sigh.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>And then, assuming steadiness, “Adieu!”      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He cried, and from the grieving Ellen flew;</div>
      <div class='line'>And to her father with a bleeding heart</div>
      <div class='line'>He went, his grief and purpose to impart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Told of his health, and did in part confess</div>
      <div class='line'>That he should love the noble maiden less.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The parent’s pride to sudden rage gave way—</div>
      <div class='line'>“And the girl loves! that plainly you would say—</div>
      <div class='line'>And you with honour, in your pride, retire!—</div>
      <div class='line'>Sir, I your prudence envy and admire.”</div>
      <div class='line'>But here the father saw the rising frown,      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And quickly let his lofty spirit down.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Forgive a parent!—I may well excuse</div>
      <div class='line'>A girl who could perceive such worth and choose</div>
      <div class='line'>To make it hers; we must not look to meet      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>All we might wish;—Is age itself discreet?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Where conquest may not be, ’tis prudence to retreat.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then, with the kindness worldly minds assume,</div>
      <div class='line'>He praised the self-pronounced and rigorous doom;</div>
      <div class='line'>He wonder’d not that one so young should love,</div>
      <div class='line'>And much he wish’d he could the choice approve;      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Much he lamented such a mind to lose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And begg’d to learn if he could aid his views,</div>
      <div class='line'>If such were form’d—then closed the short account,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to a shilling paid the full amount.—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So Cecil left the mansion, and so flew      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To foreign shores, without an interview;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He must not say, ‘I love’—he could not say, ‘Adieu!’      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Long was he absent—as a guide to youth,</div>
      <div class='line'>With grief contending, and in search of truth;</div>
      <div class='line'>In courting peace, and trying to forget      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>What was so deeply interesting yet.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A friend in England gave him all the news—</div>
      <div class='line'>sad indulgence that he would not lose.</div>
      <div class='line'>He told how Ellen suffer’d; how they sent</div>
      <div class='line'>The maid from home, in sullen discontent,</div>
      <div class='line'>With some relation on the Lakes to live,</div>
      <div class='line'>In all the sorrow such retirements give;</div>
      <div class='line'>And there she roved among the rocks, and took</div>
      <div class='line'>Moss from the stone, and pebbles from the brook;</div>
      <div class='line'>Gazed on the flies that settled on the flowers,      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And so consumed her melancholy hours.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Again he wrote—The father then was dead;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Ellen to her native village fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>With native feeling—there she oped her door,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her heart, her purse, and comforted the poor,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sick, the sad—and there she pass’d her days,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Deserving much, but never seeking praise:      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her task to guide herself, her joy the fallen to raise.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor would she nicely faults and merits weigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>But loved the impulse of her soul t’ obey;      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The prayers of all she heard, their sufferings view’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor turn’d from any, save when Love pursued;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, though to love disposed, to kindness prone,</div>
      <div class='line'>She thought of Cecil, and she lived alone.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus heard the lover of the life she past</div>
      <div class='line'>Till his return—and he return’d at last;</div>
      <div class='line'>For he had saved, and was a richer man</div>
      <div class='line'>Than when to teach and study he began;</div>
      <div class='line'>Something his father left, and he could fly</div>
      <div class='line'>To the loved country where he wish’d to die.      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And now,” he said, “this maid with gentle mind</div>
      <div class='line'>May I not hope to meet, as good, as kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>As in the days when first her friend she knew</div>
      <div class='line'>And then could trust—and he indeed is true.</div>
      <div class='line'>She knew my motives, and she must approve</div>
      <div class='line'>The man who dared to sacrifice his love</div>
      <div class='line'>And fondest hopes to virtue: virtuous she,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor can resent that sacrifice in me.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He reason’d thus, but fear’d, and sought the friend</div>
      <div class='line'>In his own country, where his doubts must end.      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>They then together to her dwelling came,</div>
      <div class='line'>And by a servant sent her lover’s name—</div>
      <div class='line'>modest youth, whom she before had known,</div>
      <div class='line'>His favourite then, and doubtless <i>then</i> her own.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They in the carriage heard the servants speak</div>
      <div class='line'>At Ellen’s door—“A maid so heavenly meek,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who would all pain extinguish! Yet will she</div>
      <div class='line'>Pronounce my doom, I feel the certainty!”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Courage!” the friend exclaim’d, “the lover’s fear</div>
      <div class='line'>Grows without ground;” but Cecil would not hear:      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He seem’d some dreadful object to explore,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fix’d his fearful eye upon the door,</div>
      <div class='line'>Intensely longing for reply—the thing</div>
      <div class='line'>That must to him his future fortune bring;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now it brought! like Death’s cold hand it came—</div>
      <div class='line'>“The lady was a stranger to the name!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Backward the lover in the carriage fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Weak, but not fainting—“All,” said he, “is well!</div>
      <div class='line'>Return with me—I have no more to seek!”</div>
      <div class='line'>And this was all the woful man would speak.      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Quickly he settled all his worldly views,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sail’d from home, his fiercer pains to lose</div>
      <div class='line'>And nurse the milder—now with labour less      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He might his solitary world possess,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And taste the bitter-sweet of love in idleness.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Greece was the land he chose; a mind decay’d      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And ruin’d there through glorious ruin stray’d;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There read, and walk’d, and mused—there loved, and wept, and pray’d.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor would he write, nor suffer hope to live,</div>
      <div class='line'>But gave to study all his mind could give;      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Till, with the dead conversing, he began</div>
      <div class='line'>To lose the habits of a living man,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save that he saw some wretched, them he tried</div>
      <div class='line'>To soothe—some doubtful, them he strove to guide;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor did he lose the mind’s ennobling joy</div>
      <div class='line'>Of that new state that death must not destroy;</div>
      <div class='line'>What Time had done we know not—Death was nigh;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To his first hopes the lover gave a sigh;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But hopes more new and strong confirm’d his wish to die.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Meantime poor Ellen in her cottage thought      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“That he would seek her—sure she should be sought</div>
      <div class='line'>She did not mean—It was an evil hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her thoughts were guardless, and beyond her power;</div>
      <div class='line'>And for one speech, and that in rashness made!</div>
      <div class='line'>Have I no friend to soothe him and persuade?</div>
      <div class='line'>He must not leave me—He again will come,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we shall have one hope, one heart, one home!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But when she heard that he on foreign ground</div>
      <div class='line'>Sought his lost peace, hers never more was found;</div>
      <div class='line'>But still she felt a varying hope that love      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Would all these slight impediments remove:—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Has he no friend to tell him that our pride</div>
      <div class='line'>Resents a moment and is satisfied?</div>
      <div class='line'>Soon as the hasty sacrifice is made,</div>
      <div class='line'>A look will soothe us, and a tear persuade;</div>
      <div class='line'>Have I no friend to say ‘Return again,</div>
      <div class='line'>Reveal your wishes, and relieve her pain?’”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With suffering mind the maid her prospects view’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>That hourly varied with the varying mood;</div>
      <div class='line'>As past the day, the week, the month, the year,      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The faint hope sicken’d, and gave place to fear.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>No Cecil came!—“Come, peevish and unjust!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Sad Ellen cried, “why cherish this disgust?</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy Ellen’s voice could charm thee once; but thou</div>
      <div class='line'>Canst nothing see or hear of Ellen now!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yes! she was right; the grave on him was closed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there the lover and the friend reposed.</div>
      <div class='line'>The news soon reach’d her, and she then replied</div>
      <div class='line'>In his own manner—“I am satisfied!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To her a lover’s legacy is paid,      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The darling wealth of the devoted maid;</div>
      <div class='line'>From this her best and favourite books she buys,</div>
      <div class='line'>From this are doled the favourite charities;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when a tale or face affects her heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>This is the fund that must relief impart.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such have the ten last years of Ellen been!</div>
      <div class='line'>Her very last that sunken eye has seen!</div>
      <div class='line'>That half-angelic being still must fade</div>
      <div class='line'>Till all the angel in the mind be made;—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>And now the closing scene will shortly come—      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She cannot visit sorrow at her home;</div>
      <div class='line'>But still she feeds the hungry; still prepares</div>
      <div class='line'>The usual softeners of the peasant’s cares;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, though she prays not with the dying now,</div>
      <div class='line'>She teaches them to die, and shows them how.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>T</span>he letters Richard in a morning read</div>
      <div class='line'>To quiet and domestic comforts led;</div>
      <div class='line'>And George, who thought the world could not supply</div>
      <div class='line'>Comfort so pure, reflected with a sigh;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then would pursue the subject, half in play,</div>
      <div class='line'>Half earnest, till the sadness wore away.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They spoke of Passion’s errors, Love’s disease,</div>
      <div class='line'>His pains, afflictions, wrongs, and jealousies;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Herod’s vile commandment—that his wife</div>
      <div class='line'>Should live no more, when he no more had life;      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He could not bear that royal Herod’s spouse</div>
      <div class='line'>Should, as a widow, make her second vows;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or that a mortal with his queen should wed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or be the rival of the mighty dead.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Herods,” said Richard, “doubtless may be found,</div>
      <div class='line'>But haply do not in the world abound;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ladies, indeed, a dreadful lot would have,</div>
      <div class='line'>If jealousy could act beyond the grave:</div>
      <div class='line'>No doubt Othellos every place supply,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though every Desdemona does not die;      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But there are lovers in the world, who live</div>
      <div class='line'>Slaves to the sex, and every fault forgive.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“I know,” said George, “a happy man and kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who finds his wife is all he wish’d to find:</div>
      <div class='line'>A mild, good man, who, if he nothing sees,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will suffer nothing to disturb his ease;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who, ever yielding both to smiles and sighs,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Admits no story that a wife denies—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She guides his mind, and she directs his eyes.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Richard, there dwells within a mile a pair      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of good examples—I will guide you there:</div>
      <div class='line'>Such man is William Bailey—but his spouse</div>
      <div class='line'>Is virtue’s self since she had made her vows.</div>
      <div class='line'>I speak of ancient stories, long worn out,</div>
      <div class='line'>That honest William would not talk about;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he will sometimes check her starting tear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And call her self-correction too severe.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“In their own inn the gentle pair are placed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where you behold the marks of William’s taste.</div>
      <div class='line'>They dwell in plenty, in respect, and peace,      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Landlord and lady of the Golden Fleece;</div>
      <div class='line'>Public indeed their calling—but there come</div>
      <div class='line'>No brawl, no revel to that decent room;</div>
      <div class='line'>All there is still, and comely to behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mild as the fleece, and pleasant as the gold.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, mild and pleasant as they now appear,</div>
      <div class='line'>They first experienced many a troubled year;</div>
      <div class='line'>And that, if known, might not command our praise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the smooth tenor of their present days.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Our hostess, now so grave and steady grown,      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Has had some awkward trials of her own.</div>
      <div class='line'>She was not always so resign’d and meek—</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet can I little of her failings speak;</div>
      <div class='line'>Those she herself will her misfortunes deem,</div>
      <div class='line'>And slides discreetly from the dubious theme.</div>
      <div class='line'>But you shall hear the tale that I will tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>When we have seen the mansion where they dwell.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They saw the mansion,—and the couple made</div>
      <div class='line'>Obeisance due, and not without parade:</div>
      <div class='line'>“His honour, still obliging, took delight      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To make them pleasant in each other’s sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>It was their duty—they were very sure</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>It was their pleasure.”</div>
      <div class='line in24'>This they could endure,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor turn’d impatient——In the room around</div>
      <div class='line'>Were care and neatness: instruments were found</div>
      <div class='line'>For sacred music, books with prints and notes</div>
      <div class='line'>By learned men and good, whom William quotes</div>
      <div class='line'>In mode familiar—Beveridge, [Doddridge,] Hall,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pyle, Whitby, Hammond—he refers to all.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Next they beheld his garden, fruitful, nice,      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, as he said, his little paradise.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In man and wife appear’d some signs of pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which they perceived not, or they would not hide—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Their honest saving; their good name, their skill;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His honour’s land, which they had grace to till;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And more, his favour shown, with all their [friends’] good will.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>This past, the visit was with kindness closed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And George was ask’d to do as he proposed.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Richard,” said he, “though I myself explore</div>
      <div class='line'>With no distaste the annals of the poor,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And may with safety to a brother show      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What of my humble friends I chance to know:      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Richard, there are who call the subjects low.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“The host and hostess of the Fleece—’tis base—</div>
      <div class='line'>Would I could cast some glory round the place!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“The lively heroine once adorn’d a farm—</div>
      <div class='line'>And William’s virtue has a kind of charm;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor shall we, in our apprehension, need</div>
      <div class='line'>Riches or rank—I think I may proceed.</div>
      <div class='line'>Virtue and worth there are who will not see      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In humble dress; but low they cannot be.”</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>The youth’s addresses pleased his favourite maid—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They wish’d for union, but were both afraid;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They saw the wedded poor—and fear the bliss delay’d;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet they appear’d a happier lass and swain</div>
      <div class='line'>Than those who will not reason or refrain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>William was honest, simple, gentle, kind,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Laborious, studious, and to thrift inclined;</div>
      <div class='line'>More neat than youthful peasant in his dress,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet so careful that it cost him less.      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He kept from inns, though doomed an inn to keep,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all his pleasures and pursuits were cheap.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet would the youth perform a generous deed,</div>
      <div class='line'>When reason saw or pity felt the need;</div>
      <div class='line'>He of his labour and his skill would lend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, of his money, to a suffering friend.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>William had manual arts—his room was graced</div>
      <div class='line'>With carving quaint, that spoke the master’s taste;</div>
      <div class='line'>But if that taste admitted some dispute,</div>
      <div class='line'>He charm’d the nymphs with flageolet and flute.      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Constant at church, and there a little proud,</div>
      <div class='line'>He sang with boldness, and he read aloud;</div>
      <div class='line'>Self-taught to write, he his example took</div>
      <div class='line'>And form’d his letters from a printed book.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I’ve heard of ladies who profess’d to see</div>
      <div class='line'>In a man’s writing what his mind must be;</div>
      <div class='line'>As Doctor Spurzheim’s pupils, when they look</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon a skull, will read it as a book—</div>
      <div class='line'>Our talents, tendencies, and likings trace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And find for all the measure and the place.      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Strange times! when thus we are completely read</div>
      <div class='line'>By man or woman, by the hand or head!</div>
      <div class='line'>Believe who can—but William’s even mind</div>
      <div class='line'>All who beheld might in his writing find;</div>
      <div class='line'>His not the scratches where we try in vain</div>
      <div class='line'>Meanings and words to construe or explain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But with our village hero to proceed—</div>
      <div class='line'>He read as learned clerks are wont to read;</div>
      <div class='line'>Solemn he was in tone, and slow in pace,</div>
      <div class='line'>By nature gifted both with strength and grace.      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Black parted locks his polish’d forehead press’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>His placid looks an easy mind confess’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>His smile content, and seldom more, convey’d—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Not like the smile of fair illusive maid,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When what she feels is hid, and what she wills betray’d.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The lighter damsels call’d his manner prim,</div>
      <div class='line'>And laugh’d at virtue so array’d in him;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>But they were wanton, as he well replied,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hoped their own would not be strongly tried:</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet was he full of glee, and had his strokes      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of rustic wit, his repartees and jokes;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor was averse, ere yet he pledged his love,</div>
      <div class='line'>To stray with damsels in the shady grove;</div>
      <div class='line'>When he would tell them, as they walk’d along,</div>
      <div class='line'>How the birds sang, and imitate their song.</div>
      <div class='line'>In fact, our rustic had his proper taste;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Was with peculiar arts and manners graced—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And Absolon had been, had Absolon been chaste.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Frances, like William, felt her heart incline</div>
      <div class='line'>To neat attire—but Frances would be fine.      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Though small the farm, the farmer’s daughter knew</div>
      <div class='line'>Her rank in life, and she would have it too:</div>
      <div class='line'>This, and this only, gave the lover pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>He thought it needless, and he judged it vain.</div>
      <div class='line'>Advice in hints he to the fault applied,</div>
      <div class='line'>And talk’d of sin, of vanity, and pride.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And what is proud,” said Frances, “but to stand</div>
      <div class='line'>Singing at church, and sawing thus your hand?</div>
      <div class='line'>Looking at heaven above, as if to bring</div>
      <div class='line'>The holy angels down to hear you sing?      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, when you write, you try with all your skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cry, no wonder that you wrote so ill!</div>
      <div class='line'>For you were ever to yourself a rule,</div>
      <div class='line'>And humbly add, you never were at school—</div>
      <div class='line'>Is that not proud?—And I have heard beside,</div>
      <div class='line'>The proudest creatures have the humblest pride.</div>
      <div class='line'>If you had read the volumes I have hired,</div>
      <div class='line'>You’d see your fault, nor try to be admired;</div>
      <div class='line'>For they who read such books can always tell</div>
      <div class='line'>The fault within, and read the mind as well.”      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>William had heard of hiring books before;</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew she read, and he inquired no more.</div>
      <div class='line'>On him the subject was completely lost;</div>
      <div class='line'>What he regarded was the time and cost;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet that was trifling—just a present whim:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Novels and stories! what were they to him?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With such slight quarrels, or with those as slight,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>They lived in love, and dream’d of its delight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her duties Fanny knew, both great and small,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she with diligence observed them all.      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>If e’er she fail’d a duty to fulfil,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas childish error, not rebellious will;</div>
      <div class='line'>For her much reading, though it touch’d her heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could neither vice nor indolence impart.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet, when from William and her friends retired,</div>
      <div class='line'>She found her reading had her mind inspired</div>
      <div class='line'>With hopes and thoughts of high mysterious things,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as the early dream of kindness brings;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then she wept, and wonder’d as she read,</div>
      <div class='line'>And new emotions in her heart were bred.      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She sometimes fancied that, when love was true,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas more than she and William ever knew;</div>
      <div class='line'>More than the shady lane in summer-eve;</div>
      <div class='line'>More than the sighing when he took his leave;</div>
      <div class='line'>More than his preference when the lads advance</div>
      <div class='line'>And choose their partners for the evening dance;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, more than midnight thoughts and morning dreams,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or talk when love and marriage are the themes:</div>
      <div class='line'>In fact, a something not to be defined,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of all subduing, all commanding kind,      <span class='linenum'>200}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That fills the fondest heart, that rules the proudest mind.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But on her lover Fanny still relied,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her best companion, her sincerest guide,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>On whom she could rely, in whom she would confide.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>All jealous fits were past; in either now</div>
      <div class='line'>Were tender wishes for the binding vow.</div>
      <div class='line'>There was no secret one alone possess’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>There was no hope that warm’d a single breast:</div>
      <div class='line'>Both felt the same concerns their thoughts employ,</div>
      <div class='line'>And neither knew one solitary joy.      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then why so easy, William? why consent</div>
      <div class='line'>To wait so long? thou wilt at last repent;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Within a month,” does Care and Prudence say,</div>
      <div class='line'>If all be ready, linger not a day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere yet the choice be made, on choice debate;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, having chosen, dally not with fate.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>While yet to wait the pair were half content,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>And half disposed their purpose to repent,</div>
      <div class='line'>A spinster-aunt, in some great baron’s place,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would see a damsel, pride of all her race;      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And Fanny, flatter’d by the matron’s call,</div>
      <div class='line'>Obey’d her aunt, and long’d to see the Hall.</div>
      <div class='line'>For halls and castles in her fancy wrought,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she accounts of love and wonder sought;</div>
      <div class='line'>There she expected strange events to learn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And take in tender secrets fond concern;</div>
      <div class='line'>There she expected lovely nymphs to view,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps to hear and meet their lovers too;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The Julias, tender souls! the Henrys kind and true.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There she expected plottings to detect,      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And—but I know not what she might expect—</div>
      <div class='line'>All she was taught in books to be her guide,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all that nature taught the nymph beside.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now that good dame had in the castle dwelt</div>
      <div class='line'>So long that she for all its people felt;</div>
      <div class='line'>She kept her sundry keys, and ruled o’er all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Female and male, domestics in the hall;</div>
      <div class='line'>By her lord trusted, worthy of her trust;</div>
      <div class='line'>Proud but obedient, bountiful but just.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She praised her lucky stars, that in her place      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She never found neglect, nor felt disgrace;</div>
      <div class='line'>To do her duty was her soul’s delight,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>This her inferiors would to theirs excite,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>This her superiors notice and requite;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To either class she gave the praises due,</div>
      <div class='line'>And still more grateful as more favour’d grew.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her lord and lady were of peerless worth,</div>
      <div class='line'>In power unmatch’d, in glory and in birth;</div>
      <div class='line'>And such the virtue of the noble race,</div>
      <div class='line'>It reach’d the meanest servant in the place.      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>All, from the chief attendant on my lord</div>
      <div class='line'>To the groom’s helper, had her civil word;</div>
      <div class='line'>From Miss Montregor, who the ladies taught,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the rude lad who in the garden wrought;</div>
      <div class='line'>From the first favourite to the meanest drudge,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were no such women, heaven should be her judge;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whatever stains were theirs, let them reside</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>In that pure place, and they were mundified;</div>
      <div class='line'>The sun of favour on their vileness shone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all their faults like morning mists were gone.      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>There was Lord Robert! could she have her choice,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the world’s masters he should have her voice;</div>
      <div class='line'>So kind and gracious in his noble ways,</div>
      <div class='line'>It was a pleasure speaking in his praise;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Lady Catharine—O! a prince’s pride</div>
      <div class='line'>Might by one smile of hers be gratified;</div>
      <div class='line'>With her would monarchs all their glory share,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in her presence banish all their care.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such was the matron, and to her the maid</div>
      <div class='line'>Was by her lover carefully convey’d.      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>When William first the invitation read</div>
      <div class='line'>It some displeasure in his spirit bred;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not that one jealous thought the man possess’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>He was by fondness, not by fear, distress’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, when his Fanny to his mind convey’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The growing treasures of the ancient maid;</div>
      <div class='line'>The thirty years, come June, of service past;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her lasting love, her life that would not last;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her power! her place! what interest! what respect</div>
      <div class='line'>She had acquired—“and shall we her neglect?”—      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“No, Frances, no!” he answer’d, “you are right;</div>
      <div class='line'>But things appear in such a different light!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her parents blest her, and as well became</div>
      <div class='line'>Their love advised her, that they might not blame;</div>
      <div class='line'>They said, “If she should earl or countess meet</div>
      <div class='line'>She should be humble, cautious, and discreet;</div>
      <div class='line'>Humble, but not abased, remembering all</div>
      <div class='line'>Are kindred sinners—children of the fall;</div>
      <div class='line'>That from the earth our being we receive,</div>
      <div class='line'>And are all equal when the earth we leave.”      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>They then advised her in a modest way</div>
      <div class='line'>To make replies to what my lord might say;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her aunt would aid her, who was now become</div>
      <div class='line'>With nobles noble, and with lords at home.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So went the pair; and William told at night</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a reception gracious and polite;</div>
      <div class='line'>He spake of galleries long and pictures tall;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>The handsome parlours, the prodigious hall;</div>
      <div class='line'>The busts, the statues, and the floors of stone;</div>
      <div class='line'>The storied arras, and the vast saloon,      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In which was placed an Indian chest and screen,</div>
      <div class='line'>With figures such as he had never seen:</div>
      <div class='line'>He told of these as men enraptured tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gave to all their praise, and all was well.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Left by the lover, the desponding maid</div>
      <div class='line'>Was of the matron’s ridicule afraid;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, when she heard a welcome frank and kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wonted firmness repossess’d her mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleased by the looks of love her aunt display’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her fond professions, and her kind parade.      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>In her own room, and with her niece apart,</div>
      <div class='line'>She gave up all the secrets of her heart;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, grown familiar, bid her Fanny come,</div>
      <div class='line'>Partake her cheer, and make herself at home.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Shut in that room, upon its cheerful board</div>
      <div class='line'>She laid the comforts of no vulgar hoard;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then press’d the damsel both with love and pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>For both she felt—and would not be denied.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Grace she pronounced before and after meat,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bless’d her God that she could talk and eat;      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then with new glee she sang her patron’s praise——</div>
      <div class='line'>“He had no paltry arts, no pimping ways;</div>
      <div class='line'>She had the roast and boil’d of every day,</div>
      <div class='line'>That sent the poor with grateful hearts away;</div>
      <div class='line'>And she was grateful——Come, my darling, think</div>
      <div class='line'>Of them you love the best, and let us drink.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And now she drank the healths of those above,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her noble friends, whom she must ever love;</div>
      <div class='line'>But not together, not the young and old,</div>
      <div class='line'>But one by one, the number duly told;      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And told their merits too—there was not one</div>
      <div class='line'>Who had not said a gracious thing or done;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor could she praise alone, but she would take</div>
      <div class='line'>A cheerful glass for every favourite’s sake,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all were favourites—till the rosy cheek</div>
      <div class='line'>Spoke for the tongue that nearly ceased to speak;</div>
      <div class='line'>That rosy cheek that now began to shine,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>And show the progress of the rosy wine.</div>
      <div class='line'>But there she ended—felt the singing head,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then pray’d as custom will’d, and so to bed.      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The morn was pleasant, and the ancient maid</div>
      <div class='line'>With her fair niece about the mansion stray’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>There was no room without th’ appropriate tale</div>
      <div class='line'>Of blood and murder, female sprite or male;</div>
      <div class='line'>There was no picture that th’ historic dame</div>
      <div class='line'>Pass’d by and gave not its peculiar fame;</div>
      <div class='line'>The births, the visits, weddings, burials, all</div>
      <div class='line'>That chanced for ages at the noble Hall.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>These, and each revolution, she could state,</div>
      <div class='line'>And give strange anecdotes of love and hate;      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>This was her first delight, her pride, her boast;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She told of many an heiress, many a toast,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of Lady Ellen’s flight, of Lord Orlando’s ghost;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The maid turn’d pale, and what should then ensue</div>
      <div class='line'>But wine and cake—the dame was frighten’d too.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The aunt and niece now walk’d about the grounds,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sometimes met the gentry in their rounds;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Do let us turn!” the timid girl exclaim’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Turn!” said the aunt, “of what are you ashamed?</div>
      <div class='line'>What is there frightful in such looks as those?      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What is it, child, you fancy or suppose?</div>
      <div class='line'>Look at Lord Robert, see if you can trace</div>
      <div class='line'>More than true honour in that handsome face!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>What! you must think, by blushing in that way,</div>
      <div class='line'>My lord has something about love to say;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I assure you that he never spoke</div>
      <div class='line'>Such things to me in earnest or in joke;</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet I meet him in all sorts of times,</div>
      <div class='line'>When wicked men are thinking of their crimes.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There! let them pass——Why, yes, indeed ’tis true      <span class='linenum'>370}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That was a look, and was design’d for you;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But what the wonder when the sight is new?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For my lord’s virtue you may take my word,</div>
      <div class='line'>He would not do a thing that was absurd.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A month had pass’d; “And when will Fanny come?”</div>
      <div class='line'>The lover ask’d, and found the parents dumb;</div>
      <div class='line'>They had not heard for more than half the space,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>And the poor maiden was in much disgrace.</div>
      <div class='line'>Silence so long they could not understand—</div>
      <div class='line'>And this of one who wrote so neat a hand;      <span class='linenum'>380&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Their sister sure would send, were aught amiss;</div>
      <div class='line'>But youth is thoughtless—there is hope in this.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As time elapsed, their wonder changed to wo:</div>
      <div class='line'>William would lose another day, and go.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, if she should be wilful and remain,</div>
      <div class='line'>He had no power to take her home again.</div>
      <div class='line'>But he would go.—He went, and he return’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>And in his look the pair his tale discern’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Stupid in grief, it seem’d not that he knew</div>
      <div class='line'>How he came home, or what he should pursue.      <span class='linenum'>390&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Fanny was gone!—her aunt was sick in bed,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Dying, she said—none cared if she were dead;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her charge, his darling, was decoy’d, was fled!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But at what time, and whither, and with whom,</div>
      <div class='line'>None seem’d to know—all surly, shy, or dumb.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Each blamed himself, all blamed the erring maid;</div>
      <div class='line'>They vow’d revenge, they cursed their fate, and pray’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>Moved by his grief, the father sought the place,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ask’d for his girl, and talk’d of her disgrace;</div>
      <div class='line'>Spoke of the villain, on whose cursed head      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He pray’d that vengeance might be amply shed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then sought his sister, and beheld her grief,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her pain, her danger,—this was no relief.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Where is my daughter? bring her to my sight!”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Brother, I’m rack’d and tortured day and night.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Talk not to me! What grief have you to tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is your soul rack’d, or is your bosom hell?</div>
      <div class='line'>Where is my daughter?”—“She would take her oath</div>
      <div class='line'>For their right doing, for she knew them both,</div>
      <div class='line'>And my young lord was honour.”—“Woman, cease!      <span class='linenum'>410}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And give your guilty conscience no such peace—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>You’ve sold the wretched girl, you have betray’d your niece.”—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“The Lord be good! and O! the pains that come</div>
      <div class='line'>In limb and body—Brother, get you home!</div>
      <div class='line'>Your voice runs through me—every angry word,</div>
      <div class='line'>If he should hear it, would offend my lord.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“Has he a daughter? let her run away</div>
      <div class='line'>With a poor dog, and hear what he will say!</div>
      <div class='line'>No matter what, I’ll ask him for his son”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“And so offend? Now, brother, pray be gone!”      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>My lord appear’d, perhaps by pity moved,</div>
      <div class='line'>And kindly said he no such things approved;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, he was angry with the foolish boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who might his pleasures at his ease enjoy;</div>
      <div class='line'>The thing was wrong—he hoped the farm did well—</div>
      <div class='line'>The angry father doom’d the farm to hell;</div>
      <div class='line'>He then desired to see the villain-son,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though my lord warn’d him such excess to shun;</div>
      <div class='line'>Told him he pardon’d, though he blamed such rage,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bade him think upon his state and age.      <span class='linenum'>430&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Think! yes, my lord! but thinking drives me mad—</div>
      <div class='line'>Give me my child!—Where is she to be had?</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m old and poor, but I with both can feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so shall he that could a daughter steal!</div>
      <div class='line'>Think you, my lord, I can be so bereft</div>
      <div class='line'>And feel no vengeance for the villain’s theft?</div>
      <div class='line'>Old if I am, could I the robber meet</div>
      <div class='line'>I’d lay his breathless body at my feet—</div>
      <div class='line'>Was that a smile, my lord? think you your boy</div>
      <div class='line'>Will both the father and the child destroy?”      <span class='linenum'>440&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>My lord replied—“I’m sorry, from my soul!</div>
      <div class='line'>But boys are boys, and there is no control.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“So, for your great ones Justice slumbers, then!</div>
      <div class='line'>If men are poor they must not feel as men—</div>
      <div class='line'>Will your son marry?”—“Marry!” said my lord,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Your daughter?—marry—no, upon my word!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“What then, our stations differ!—but your son</div>
      <div class='line'>Thought not of that—his crime has made them one,</div>
      <div class='line'>In guilt united—She shall be his wife,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or I th’ avenger that will take his life!”—      <span class='linenum'>450&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Old man, I pity and forgive you; rest      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In hope and comfort—be not so distress’d;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Things that seem bad oft happen for the best.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The girl has done no more than thousands do,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor has the boy—they laugh at me and you.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“And this my vengeance—curse him!”—“Nay, forbear;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>I spare your frenzy, in compassion spare.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Spare me, my lord! and what have I to dread?</div>
      <div class='line'>O! spare not, heaven, the thunder o’er his head—</div>
      <div class='line'>The bolt he merits!”——</div>
      <div class='line in24'>Such was his redress;      <span class='linenum'>460&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And he return’d to brood upon distress.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And what of William?—William from the time</div>
      <div class='line'>Appear’d partaker both of grief and crime;</div>
      <div class='line'>He cared for nothing, nothing he pursued,</div>
      <div class='line'>But walk’d about in melancholy mood;</div>
      <div class='line'>He ceased to labour—all he loved before</div>
      <div class='line'>He now neglected, and would see no more;</div>
      <div class='line'>He said his flute brought only to his mind</div>
      <div class='line'>When he was happy, and his Fanny kind;</div>
      <div class='line'>And his loved walks, and every object near,      <span class='linenum'>470&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And every evening-sound she loved to hear,</div>
      <div class='line'>The shady lane, broad heath, and starry sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>Brought home reflections, and he wish’d to die.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet there he stray’d, because he wish’d to shun</div>
      <div class='line'>The world he hated, where his part was done;</div>
      <div class='line'>As if, though lingering on the earth, he there</div>
      <div class='line'>Had neither hope nor calling, tie nor care.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At length a letter from the daughter came,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Frances’ subscribed, and that the only name;</div>
      <div class='line'>She “pitied much her parents, spoke of fate,      <span class='linenum'>480&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And begg’d them to forget her, not to hate;</div>
      <div class='line'>Said she had with her all the world could give,</div>
      <div class='line'>And only pray’d that they in peace should live.</div>
      <div class='line'>That which is done is that we’re born to do—</div>
      <div class='line'>This she was taught, and she believed it true;</div>
      <div class='line'>True, that she lived in pleasure and delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>But often dream’d and saw the farm by night;</div>
      <div class='line'>The boarded room that she had kept so neat,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all her roses in the window-seat;</div>
      <div class='line'>The pear-tree shade, the jasmine’s lovely gloom,      <span class='linenum'>490&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With its long twigs that blossom’d in the room;</div>
      <div class='line'>But she was happy, and the tears that fell      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As she was writing had no grief to tell;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>We weep when we are glad, we sigh when we are well.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>A bill inclosed, that they beheld with pain</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>And indignation, they return’d again;</div>
      <div class='line'>There was no mention made of William’s name,</div>
      <div class='line'>Check’d as she was by pity, love, and shame.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>William, who wrought for bread, and never sought</div>
      <div class='line'>More than the day demanded when he wrought,      <span class='linenum'>500&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Was to a sister call’d, of all his race</div>
      <div class='line'>The last, and dying in a distant place.</div>
      <div class='line'>In tender terror he approach’d her bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beheld her sick, and buried her when dead;</div>
      <div class='line'>He was her heir, and what she left was more</div>
      <div class='line'>Than he required, who was content before.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With their minds’ sufferings, age, and growing pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>That ancient couple could not long remain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor long remain’d; and in their dying groan</div>
      <div class='line'>The suffering youth perceived himself alone;      <span class='linenum'>510&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For of his health or sickness, peace or care,</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew not one in all the world to share.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now every scene would sad reflections give,</div>
      <div class='line'>And most his home, and there he could not live;</div>
      <div class='line'>There every walk would now distressing prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>And of his loss remind him, and his love.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With the small portion by his sister left</div>
      <div class='line'>He roved about as one of peace bereft;</div>
      <div class='line'>And by the body’s movements hoped to find</div>
      <div class='line'>A kind of wearied stillness in the mind,      <span class='linenum'>520&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And sooner bring it to a sleepy state,</div>
      <div class='line'>As rocking infants will their pains abate.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus careless, lost, unheeding where he went,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nine weary years the wandering lover spent.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His sole employment, all that could amuse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was his companions on the road to choose;</div>
      <div class='line'>With such he travell’d through the passing day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Friends of the hour, and walkers by the way;</div>
      <div class='line'>And from the sick, the poor, the halt, the blind,</div>
      <div class='line'>He learn’d the sorrows of his suffering kind.      <span class='linenum'>530&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>He learn’d of many how unjust their fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>For their connexions dwelt in better state;</div>
      <div class='line'>They had relations famous, great or rich,</div>
      <div class='line'>Learned or wise, they never scrupled which;</div>
      <div class='line'>But while they cursed these kindred churls, would try</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>To build their fame, and for their glory lie.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Others delighted in misfortunes strange,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sports of fortune in her love for change.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Some spoke of wonders they before had seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>When on their travels they had wandering been:      <span class='linenum'>540&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>How they had sail’d the world about, and found</div>
      <div class='line'>The sailing plain, although the world was round;</div>
      <div class='line'>How they beheld for months th’ unsetting sun;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What deeds they saw! what they themselves had done!—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What leaps at Rhodes!—what glory then they won!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>There were who spoke in terms of high disdain</div>
      <div class='line'>Of their contending against power in vain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Suffering from tyranny of law long borne;</div>
      <div class='line'>And life’s best spirits in contentions worn.</div>
      <div class='line'>Happy in this, th’ oppressors soon will die,      <span class='linenum'>550}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Each with the vex’d and suffering man to lie—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And thus consoled exclaim, ‘And is not sorrow dry?’      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But vice offended: when he met with those</div>
      <div class='line'>Who could a deed of violence propose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cry, “Should they what we desire possess?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Should they deprive us, and their laws oppress?”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>William would answer, “Ours is not redress.”—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Would you oppression, then, for ever feel?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis not my choice; but yet I must not steal.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“So, first they cheat us, and then make their laws      <span class='linenum'>560&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To guard their treasures and to back their cause:</div>
      <div class='line'>What call you then, my friend, the rights of man?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“To get his bread,” said William, “if he can;</div>
      <div class='line'>And if he cannot, he must then depend      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Upon a Being he may make his friend.”—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Make!” they replied; and conference had end.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But female vagrants would at times express</div>
      <div class='line'>A new-born pleasure at the mild address;</div>
      <div class='line'>His modest wish, clothed in accent meek,</div>
      <div class='line'>That they would comfort in religion seek.      <span class='linenum'>570&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“I am a sinful being!” William cried;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Then, what am I?” the conscious heart replied;</div>
      <div class='line'>And oft-times ponder’d in a pensive way,</div>
      <div class='line'>“He is not happy, yet he loves to pray.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But some would freely on his thoughts intrude,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>And thrust themselves ’twixt him and solitude;</div>
      <div class='line'>They would his faith and of its strength demand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all his soul’s prime motions understand.</div>
      <div class='line'>“How!” they would say, “such we and such belief,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such trust in heaven, and yet on earth such grief!      <span class='linenum'>580&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Thou art almost, my friend—thou art not all;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou hast not yet the self-destroying call;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou hast a carnal wish, perhaps a will</div>
      <div class='line'>Not yet subdued—the root is growing still.</div>
      <div class='line'>There is the strong man yet that keeps his own,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who by a stronger must be overthrown;</div>
      <div class='line'>There is the burden that must yet be gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then the pilgrim may go singing on.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>William to this would seriously incline,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to their comforts would his heart resign;      <span class='linenum'>590&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It soothed, it raised him—he began to feel</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ enlivening warmth of methodistic zeal;</div>
      <div class='line'>He learn’d to know the brethren by their looks—</div>
      <div class='line'>He sought their meetings, he perused their books;</div>
      <div class='line'>But yet was not within the pale and yoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>And as a novice of experience spoke;</div>
      <div class='line'>But felt the comfort, and began to pray</div>
      <div class='line'>For such companions on the king’s highway.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>William had now across the kingdom sped,</div>
      <div class='line'>To th’ Eastern ocean from St. David’s head;      <span class='linenum'>600&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And wandering late, with various thoughts oppress’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas midnight ere he reach’d his place of rest—</div>
      <div class='line'>A village inn, that one way-faring friend</div>
      <div class='line'>Could from experience safely recommend:</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the kind hostess would be more intent</div>
      <div class='line'>On what he needed than on what he spent;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her husband, once a heathen, she subdued,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with religious fear his mind imbued;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though his conviction came too late to save</div>
      <div class='line'>An erring creature from an early grave.      <span class='linenum'>610&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Since that event, the cheerful widow grew      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In size and substance—her the brethren knew—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And many friends were hers, and lovers not a few;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But either love no more could warm her heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or no man came who could the warmth impart.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>William drew near, and saw the comely look</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the good lady, bending o’er her book;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hymns it appear’d—for now a pleasing sound</div>
      <div class='line'>Seem’d as a welcome in his wanderings found.</div>
      <div class='line'>He enter’d softly, not as they who think      <span class='linenum'>620&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That they may act the ruffian if they drink,</div>
      <div class='line'>And who conceive, that for their paltry pence</div>
      <div class='line'>They may with rules of decency dispense;</div>
      <div class='line'>Far unlike these was William—he was kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Exacting nothing, and to all resign’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He saw the hostess reading,—and their eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Met in good will, and something like surprise.</div>
      <div class='line'>It was not beauty William saw, but more,</div>
      <div class='line'>Something like that which he had loved before—</div>
      <div class='line'>Something that brought his Fanny to his view,      <span class='linenum'>630&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In the dear time when she was good and true;</div>
      <div class='line'>And his, it seem’d, were features that were seen      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With some emotion—she was not serene;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And both were moved to ask what looks like those could mean.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At first, she colour’d to the deepest red,</div>
      <div class='line'>That hurried off, till all the rose was fled;</div>
      <div class='line'>She call’d a servant, whom she sent to rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then made excuse to her attentive guest;</div>
      <div class='line'>She own’d the thoughts confused—’twas very true,</div>
      <div class='line'>He brought a dear departed friend in view;      <span class='linenum'>640&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then, as he listen’d, bade him welcome there      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With livelier looks and more engaging air,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And stirr’d the fire of ling, and brush’d the wicker chair;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Waiting his order, with the cheerful look</div>
      <div class='line'>That proved how pleasant were the pains she took.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He was refresh’d——They spake on various themes—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Our early pleasures, Reason’s first-drawn schemes,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Youth’s strong illusions, Love’s delirious dreams;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then from her book he would presume to ask</div>
      <div class='line'>A song of praise, and she perform’d the task.      <span class='linenum'>650&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The clock struck twelve—He started—‘Must I go?’</div>
      <div class='line'>His looks spoke plainly, and the lady’s, ‘No;’</div>
      <div class='line'>So down he sat—and, when the clock struck one,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>There was no start, no effort to be gone;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor stay’d discourse——</div>
      <div class='line in26'>“And so your loves were cross’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the loved object to your wishes lost?</div>
      <div class='line'>But was she faithless, or were you to blame?</div>
      <div class='line'>I wish I knew her—Will you tell her name?”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Excuse me—that would hurt her if alive;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if no more, why should her fault survive?”      <span class='linenum'>660&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“But love you still?”—</div>
      <div class='line in24'>“Alas! I feel I do,</div>
      <div class='line'>When I behold her very looks in you!”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Yet, if the frail one’s name must not be known,</div>
      <div class='line'>My friendly guest may trust me with his own.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This done, the lady paused, and then replied—</div>
      <div class='line'>It grieves me much to see your spirit tried;—</div>
      <div class='line'>But she was like me—how I came to know</div>
      <div class='line'>The lamb that stray’d I will hereafter show.—</div>
      <div class='line'>We were indeed as sisters——Should I state</div>
      <div class='line'>Her quiet end, you would no longer hate;      <span class='linenum'>670&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I see your heart—and I shall quickly prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though she deserved not, yet she priced your love:</div>
      <div class='line'>Long as she breathed was heard her William’s name—</div>
      <div class='line'>And such affection half absolves her shame.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Weep not, but hear me, how I came to know</div>
      <div class='line'>Thee and thy Frances—this to heaven I owe;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou shalt view the pledge, the very ring,</div>
      <div class='line'>The birth-day token—well you know the thing;</div>
      <div class='line'>‘This,’ if I ever—thus I was to speak,</div>
      <div class='line'>As she had spoken—but I see you weak:      <span class='linenum'>680&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She was not worthy——”</div>
      <div class='line in26'>“O! you cannot tell</div>
      <div class='line'>By what accursed means my Fanny fell!</div>
      <div class='line'>What bane, compulsion, threats—for she was pure;</div>
      <div class='line'>But from such toils what being is secure?</div>
      <div class='line'>Force, not persuasion, robb’d me——”</div>
      <div class='line in40'>“You are right;</div>
      <div class='line'>So has she told me, in her Maker’s sight:</div>
      <div class='line'>She loved not vice——”</div>
      <div class='line in26'>“O! no—her heart approved</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>All that her God commanded to be loved;</div>
      <div class='line'>And she is gone”——</div>
      <div class='line in23'>“Consider! death alone</div>
      <div class='line'>Could for the errors of her life atone.”—      <span class='linenum'>690&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Speak not of them; I would she knew how dear</div>
      <div class='line'>I hold her yet!—But dost thou give the tear</div>
      <div class='line'>To my loved Frances?—No! I cannot part</div>
      <div class='line'>With one who has her face, who has her heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>With looks so pleasing, when I thee behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>She lives—that bosom is no longer cold—</div>
      <div class='line'>Then tell me—Art thou not—in pity speak—</div>
      <div class='line'>One whom I sought, while living meant to seek—</div>
      <div class='line'>Art thou my Fanny?—Let me not offend—</div>
      <div class='line'>Be something to me—be a sufferer’s friend—      <span class='linenum'>700&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Be more—be all! ——The precious truth confess—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Art thou not Frances?”——      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in29'>“O, my William! yes!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But spare me, spare thyself, and suffer less.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In my best days, the spring-time of my life,</div>
      <div class='line'>I was not worthy to be William’s wife;</div>
      <div class='line'>A widow now—not poor, indeed—not cast</div>
      <div class='line'>In outer darkness—sorrowing for the past,</div>
      <div class='line'>And for the future hoping—but no more:</div>
      <div class='line'>Let me the pledges of thy love restore,</div>
      <div class='line'>And give the ring thou gavest—let it be      <span class='linenum'>710&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A token still of my regard for thee—</div>
      <div class='line'>But only that—and to a worthier now</div>
      <div class='line'>Consign the gift.”——</div>
      <div class='line in25'>“The only worthy thou!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Replied the lover; and what more express’d</div>
      <div class='line'>May be omitted—here our tale shall rest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This pair, our host and hostess of the Fleece,</div>
      <div class='line'>Command some wealth, and smile at its increase;</div>
      <div class='line'>Saving and civil, cautious and discreet,</div>
      <div class='line'>All sects and parties in their mansion meet;</div>
      <div class='line'>There from their chapels teachers go to share      <span class='linenum'>720&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The creature-comforts—mockery grins not there;</div>
      <div class='line'>There meet the wardens at their annual feast,</div>
      <div class='line'>With annual pun—‘the parish must be fleeced’;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>There traders find a parlour cleanly swept</div>
      <div class='line'>For their reception, and in order kept;</div>
      <div class='line'>And there the sons of labour, poor, but free,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sit and enjoy their hour of liberty.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So live the pair—and life’s disasters seem</div>
      <div class='line'>In their unruffled calm a troubled dream;</div>
      <div class='line'>In comfort runs the remnant of their life—      <span class='linenum'>730&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>With some degree of reverence recall.</div>
      <div class='line'>George then reverted to the days of old,</div>
      <div class='line'>When his heart fainted, and his hope was cold;</div>
      <div class='line'>When by the power of fancy he was sway’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every impulse of the mind obey’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Then, my dear Richard,” said the ‘Squire, “my case</div>

      <div class='line'>Of this a part was habitable made;</div>
      <div class='line'>The rest—who doubts?—was by the spirits seized,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>“The worthy farmer tenant yet remain’d,</div>

      <div class='line'>Him there I sought whom I had loved so well—</div>
      <div class='line'>For sure he dwelt where happy spirits dwell!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“While thus engaged, I started at a sound,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of what I knew not, but I look’d around;</div>
      <div class='line'>For I was borne on visionary wings,      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And felt no dread of sublunary things;</div>
      <div class='line'>But rising, walk’d.—A distant window threw</div>
      <div class='line'>A weak, soft light, that help’d me in my view;</div>
      <div class='line'>Something with anxious heart I hoped to see,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pray’d, ‘O! God of all things, let it be!</div>
      <div class='line'>For all are thine, were made by thee, and thou</div>
      <div class='line'>Canst both the meeting and the means allow;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou canst make clear my sight, or thou canst make</div>
      <div class='line'>More gross the form that his loved mind shall take,</div>
      <div class='line'>Canst clothe his spirit for my fleshly sight,      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or make my earthly sense more pure and bright.’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“So was I speaking, when without a sound</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a movement in the sacred ground:</div>
      <div class='line'>I saw a figure rising, but could trace</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>No certain features, no peculiar face;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I prepared my mind that form to view,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor felt a doubt—he promised, and was true!</div>
      <div class='line'>I should embrace his angel, and my clay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what was mortal in me, melt away.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“O! that ecstatic horror in my frame,      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That o’er me thus, a favour’d mortal, came!</div>
      <div class='line'>Bless’d beyond mortals—and the body now</div>
      <div class='line'>I judged would perish, though I knew not how;</div>
      <div class='line'>The gracious power around me could translate</div>
      <div class='line'>And make me pass to that immortal state:</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus shall I pay the debt that must be paid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dying live, nor be by death delay’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when so changed, I should with joy sustain</div>
      <div class='line'>The heavenly converse, and with him remain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I saw the distant shade, and went with awe,      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But not with terror, to the form I saw;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet slowly went, for he I did believe</div>
      <div class='line'>Would meet, and soul to soul his friend receive;</div>
      <div class='line'>So on I drew, concluding in my mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>I cannot judge what laws may spirits bind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though I dissolve, and mingle with the blest,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I am a new and uninstructed guest,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And ere my love can speak, he should be first address’d.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Thus I began to speak—my new-born pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>My love, and daring hope, the words supplied.      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘Dear, happy shade! companion of the good,</div>
      <div class='line'>The just, the pure, do I on thee intrude?</div>
      <div class='line'>Art thou not come my spirit to improve,</div>
      <div class='line'>To form, instruct, and fit me for thy love,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as in love we parted, to restore</div>
      <div class='line'>The blessing lost, and then to part no more?</div>
      <div class='line'>Let me with thee in thy pure essence dwell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor go to bid them of my house farewell,</div>
      <div class='line'>But thine be ever!’—How shall I relate</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ event that finish’d this ecstatic state?      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet let me try.—It turn’d, and I beheld</div>
      <div class='line'>An hideous form, that hope and zeal expell’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>In a dim light the horrid shape appeared,</div>
      <div class='line'>That wisdom would have fled, and courage fear’d:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Pale, and yet bloated, with distorted eyes      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Distant and deep, a mouth of monstrous size,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That would in day’s broad glare a simple maid surprise.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He heard my words, and cried, with savage shout,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Bah!—bother!—blarney!—What is this about?’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Love, lover, longing, in an instant fled,—      <span class='linenum'>380&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Now I had vice and impudence to dread;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all my high-wrought fancies died away</div>
      <div class='line'>To woman’s trouble, terror, and dismay.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘What,’ said the wretch, ‘what is it you would have?</div>
      <div class='line'>Would’st hang a man for peeping in a grave?</div>
      <div class='line'>Search me yourself, and try if you can feel</div>
      <div class='line'>Aught I have taken—there was nought to steal:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas told they buried with the corpse enough</div>
      <div class='line'>To pay the hazard—I have made the proof,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor gain’d a tester—What I tell is true;      <span class='linenum'>390}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But I’m no fool, to be betray’d by you—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll hazard nothing, curse me if I do!’      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“The light increased, and plainly now appear’d</div>
      <div class='line'>A knavish fool, whom I had often fear’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>But hid the dread; and I resolved at least</div>
      <div class='line'>Not to expose it to the powerful beast.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘Come, John,’ I said, suppressing fear and doubt,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Walk on before, and let a lady out!’—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Lady!’ the wretch replied, with savage grin,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Apply to him that let the lady in:      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What! you would go, I take it, to the Dean,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tell him what your ladyship has seen’.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“When thus the fool exposed the knave, I saw      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The means of holding such a mind in awe,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And gain my safety by his dread of law.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘Alas!’ I cried, ‘I fear the Dean like you,</div>
      <div class='line'>For I transgress, and am in trouble too.</div>
      <div class='line'>If it be known that we are here, as sure</div>
      <div class='line'>As here we are we must the law endure:</div>
      <div class='line'>Each other’s counsel therefore let us keep,      <span class='linenum'>410&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And each steal homeward to our beds and sleep,’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘Steal!’ said the ruffian’s conscience—‘Well, agreed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Steal on, and let us to the door proceed:’—</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, ere he moved, he stood awhile, and took</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Of my poor form a most alarming look;</div>
      <div class='line'>‘But, hark!’ I cried, and he to move began—</div>
      <div class='line'>Escape alone engaged the dreadful man;</div>
      <div class='line'>With eager hand I oped the ponderous door—</div>
      <div class='line'>The wretch rush’d by me, and was heard no more.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“So I escaped,—and when my dreams came on,      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I check’d the madness by the thoughts of John;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet say I not what can or cannot be,</div>
      <div class='line'>But give the story of my ghost and me.”</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>T</span>here was a widow in the village known</div>
      <div class='line'>To our good Squire, and he had favour shown</div>
      <div class='line'>By frequent bounty.—She as usual came;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Richard saw the worn and weary frame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pale cheek, and eye subdued, of her whose mind      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Was grateful still, and glad a friend to find,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Though to the world long since and all its hopes resign’d.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her easy form, in rustic neatness clad,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was pleasing still! but she for ever sad.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Deep is her grief?” said Richard—“Truly deep,      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And very still, and therefore seems to sleep.</div>
      <div class='line'>To borrow simile to paint her woes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Theirs, like the river’s, motion seems repose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Making no petty murmuring—settled, slow,</div>
      <div class='line'>They never waste, they never overflow.</div>
      <div class='line'>Rachel is one of those—for there are some</div>
      <div class='line'>Who look for nothing in their days to come,</div>
      <div class='line'>No good nor evil, neither hope nor fear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nothing remains or cheerful or severe;</div>
      <div class='line'>One day is like the past, the year’s sweet prime      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Like the sad fall—for Rachel heeds not time.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nothing remains to agitate her breast;</div>
      <div class='line'>Spent is the tempest, and the sky at rest;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>But, while it raged, her peace its ruin met;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now the sun is on her prospects set.—</div>
      <div class='line'>Leave her, and let us her distress explore:</div>
      <div class='line'>She heeds it not—she has been left before.”</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>There were two lads, call’d Shelley, hither brought,</div>
      <div class='line'>But whence we know not—it was never sought;</div>
      <div class='line'>Their wandering mother left them, left her name,      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And the boys throve and valiant men became:</div>
      <div class='line'>Handsome, of more than common size, and tall,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, no one’s kindred, seem’d beloved of all;</div>
      <div class='line'>All seem’d alliance by their deeds to prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>And loved the youths who could not claim their love.</div>
      <div class='line'>One was call’d James, the more sedate and grave,</div>
      <div class='line'>The other Robert—names their neighbours gave;</div>
      <div class='line'>They both were brave, but Robert loved to run</div>
      <div class='line'>And meet his danger—James would rather shun</div>
      <div class='line'>The dangerous trial; but, whenever tried,      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He all his spirit to the act applied.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Robert would aid on any man bestow,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>James would his man and the occasion know;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For that was quick and prompt—this temperate and slow.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Robert would all things he desired pursue,</div>
      <div class='line'>James would consider what was best to do;</div>
      <div class='line'>All spoke of Robert as a man they loved,</div>
      <div class='line'>And most of James as valued and approved.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Both had some learning: Robert his acquired</div>
      <div class='line'>By quicker parts, and was by praise inspired;      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>James, as he was in his acquirements slow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would learn the worth of what he tried to know.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In fact, this youth was generous—that was just;</div>
      <div class='line'>The one you loved, the other you would trust;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet him you loved you would for truth approve,</div>
      <div class='line'>And him you trusted you would likewise love.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such were the brothers—James had found his way      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To Nether Hall, and there inclined to stay;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He could himself command, and therefore could obey.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>He with the keeper took his daily round,      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A rival grew, and some unkindness found;</div>
      <div class='line'>But his superior farm’d! the place was void,</div>
      <div class='line'>And James guns, dogs, and dignity enjoy’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Robert had scorn of service; he would be</div>
      <div class='line'>A slave to no man—happy were the free,</div>
      <div class='line'>And only they;—by such opinions led,</div>
      <div class='line'>Robert to sundry kinds of trade was bred.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor let us wonder if he sometimes made</div>
      <div class='line'>An active partner in a lawless trade;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fond of adventure, wanton as the wave,      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He loved the danger and the law to brave;</div>
      <div class='line'>But these were chance-adventures, known to few—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not that the hero cared what people knew.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The brothers met not often—When they met,</div>
      <div class='line'>James talk’d of honest gains and scorn of debt,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of virtuous labour, of a sober life,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what with credit would support a wife.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But Robert answer’d—“How can men advise</div>
      <div class='line'>Who to a master let their tongue and eyes?</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose words are not their own? whose foot and hand      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Run at a nod, or act upon command?</div>
      <div class='line'>Who cannot eat or drink, discourse or play,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without requesting others that they may.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Debt you would shun; but what advice to give,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who owe your service every hour you live!</div>
      <div class='line'>Let a bell sound, and from your friends you run,</div>
      <div class='line'>Although the darling of your heart were one;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, if the bondage fits you, I resign</div>
      <div class='line'>You to your lot—I am content with mine!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus would the lads their sentiments express,      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And part in earnest, part in playfulness;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till Love, controller of all hearts and eyes,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Breaker of bonds, of friendship’s holy ties,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Awakener of new wills and slumbering sympathies,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Began his reign—till Rachel, meek-eyed maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>That form, those cheeks, that faultless face display’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>That child of gracious nature, ever neat</div>
      <div class='line'>And never fine; a flowret simply sweet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seeming at least unconscious she was fair;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Meek in her spirit, timid in her air,      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And shrinking from his glance if one presumed</div>
      <div class='line'>To come too near the beauty as it bloom’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Robert beheld her in her father’s cot</div>
      <div class='line'>Day after day, and blest his happy lot;</div>
      <div class='line'>He look’d indeed, but he could not offend</div>
      <div class='line'>By gentle looks—he was her father’s friend.</div>
      <div class='line'>She was accustom’d to that tender look,</div>
      <div class='line'>And frankly gave the hand he fondly took;</div>
      <div class='line'>She loved his stories, pleased she heard him play;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Pensive herself, she loved to see him gay;      <span class='linenum'>110}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, if they loved not yet, they were in Love’s highway.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But Rachel now to womanhood was grown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And would no more her faith and fondness own;</div>
      <div class='line'>She called her latent prudence to her aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And grew observant, cautious, and afraid;</div>
      <div class='line'>She heard relations of her lover’s guile,</div>
      <div class='line'>And could believe the danger of his smile.</div>
      <div class='line'>With art insidious rival damsels strove</div>
      <div class='line'>To show how false his speech, how feign’d his love;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, though her heart another story told,      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her speech grew cautious, and her manner cold.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Rachel had village fame, was fair and tall,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gain’d a place of credit at the Hall;</div>
      <div class='line'>Where James beheld her seated in that place,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a child’s meekness and an angel’s face;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her temper soft, her spirit firm, her words</div>
      <div class='line'>Simple and few as simple truth affords.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James could but love her—he at church had seen</div>
      <div class='line'>The tall, fair maid; had met her on the green;</div>
      <div class='line'>Admiring always, nor surprised to find      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her figure often present to his mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>But now he saw her daily, and the sight</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave him new pleasure and increased delight.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But James, still prudent and reserved, though sure</div>
      <div class='line'>The love he felt was love that would endure,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would wait awhile, observing what was fit,</div>
      <div class='line'>And meet, and right, nor would himself commit.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then was he flatter’d—James in time became</div>
      <div class='line'>Rich, both as slayer of the Baron’s game,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>And as protector—not a female dwelt      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In that demesne who had not feign’d or felt</div>
      <div class='line'>Regard for James; and he from all had praise</div>
      <div class='line'>Enough a young man’s vanity to raise;</div>
      <div class='line'>With all these pleasures he of course must part</div>
      <div class='line'>When Rachel reign’d sole empress of his heart.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Robert was now deprived of that delight</div>
      <div class='line'>He once experienced in his mistress’ sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, though he now his frequent visits paid,</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw but little of the cautious maid;</div>
      <div class='line'>The simple, common pleasures that he took      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Grew dull, and he the wonted haunts forsook;</div>
      <div class='line'>His flute and song he left, his book and pen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sought the meetings of adventurous men.</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a love-born sadness in his breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>That wanted stimulus to bring on rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>These simple pleasures were no more of use,</div>
      <div class='line'>And danger only could repose produce;</div>
      <div class='line'>He join’d th’ associates in their lawless trade,</div>
      <div class='line'>And was at length of their profession made.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He saw connected with th’ adventurous crew      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Those whom he judged were sober men and true;</div>
      <div class='line'>He found that some, who should the trade prevent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave it by purchase their encouragement;</div>
      <div class='line'>He found that contracts could be made with those</div>
      <div class='line'>Who had their pay these dealers to oppose;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the good ladies whom at church he saw,</div>
      <div class='line'>With looks devout, of reverence and awe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could change their feelings as they change their place,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, whispering, deal for spicery and lace:</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus the craft and avarice of these      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Urged on the youth, and gave his conscience ease.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Him loved the maiden Rachel, fondly loved,</div>
      <div class='line'>As many a sigh and tear in absence proved,</div>
      <div class='line'>And many a fear for dangers that she knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And many a doubt what one so gay might do.</div>
      <div class='line'>Of guilt she thought not—she had often heard</div>
      <div class='line'>They bought and sold, and nothing wrong appear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her father’s maxim this; she understood</div>
      <div class='line'>There was some ill—but he, she knew, was good;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>It was a traffic—but was done by night—      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>If wrong, how trade? why secrecy, if right?</div>
      <div class='line'>But Robert’s conscience, she believed, was pure—</div>
      <div class='line'>And that he read his Bible she was sure.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James, better taught, in confidence declared</div>
      <div class='line'>His grief for what his guilty brother dared:</div>
      <div class='line'>He sigh’d to think how near he was akin</div>
      <div class='line'>To one [seduced] by godless men to sin;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who, being always of the law in dread,</div>
      <div class='line'>To other crimes were by the danger led,</div>
      <div class='line'>And crimes with like excuse——The smuggler cries,      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“What guilt is his who pays for what he buys?”</div>
      <div class='line'>The poacher questions, with perverted mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Were not the gifts of heaven for all design’d?”</div>
      <div class='line'><i>This</i> cries, “I sin not—take not till I pay;”—</div>
      <div class='line'><i>That</i>, “My own hand brought down my proper prey.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>And while to such fond arguments they cling,</div>
      <div class='line'>How fear they God? how honour they the king?</div>
      <div class='line'>Such men associate, and each other aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till all are guilty, rash, and desperate made;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till to some lawless deed the wretches fly,      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And in the act or for the acting, die.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The maid was frighten’d—but, if this was true,</div>
      <div class='line'>Robert for certain no such danger knew;</div>
      <div class='line'>He always pray’d ere he a trip begun,</div>
      <div class='line'>And was too happy for a wicked man.</div>
      <div class='line'>How could a creature, who was always gay,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So kind to all men, so disposed to pray,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>How could he give his heart to such an evil way?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet she had fears—for she could not believe</div>
      <div class='line'>That James could lie, or purpose to deceive;      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But still she found, though not without respect</div>
      <div class='line'>For one so good, she must the man reject:</div>
      <div class='line'>For, simple though she was, full well she knew</div>
      <div class='line'>What this strong friendship led him to pursue;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, let the man be honest as the light,</div>
      <div class='line'>Love warps the mind a little from the right;</div>
      <div class='line'>And she proposed, against the trying day,</div>
      <div class='line'>What in the trial she should think and say.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And now, their love avow’d, in both arose</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Fear and disdain—the orphan pair were foes.      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Robert, more generous of the two, avow’d</div>
      <div class='line'>His scorn, defiance, and contempt aloud.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James talk’d of pity in a softer tone,</div>
      <div class='line'>To Rachel speaking, and with her alone:</div>
      <div class='line'>“He knew full well,” he said, “to what must come</div>
      <div class='line'>His wretched brother, what would be his doom.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus he her bosom fenced with dread about;</div>
      <div class='line'>But love he could not with his skill drive out.</div>
      <div class='line'>Still, he effected something—and that skill</div>
      <div class='line'>Made the love wretched, though it could not kill;      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And Robert fail’d, though much he tried, to prove</div>
      <div class='line'>He had no guilt—She granted he had love.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus they proceeded, till a winter came,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the stern keeper told of stolen game.</div>
      <div class='line'>Throughout the woods the poaching dogs had been;</div>
      <div class='line'>And from him nothing should the robbers screen,</div>
      <div class='line'>From him and law—he would all hazards run,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor spare a poacher, were his brother one—</div>
      <div class='line'>Love, favour, interest, tie of blood should fail,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till vengeance bore him bleeding to the jail.      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Poor Rachel shudder’d—smuggling she could name</div>
      <div class='line'>Without confusion, for she felt not shame;</div>
      <div class='line'>But poachers were her terror, and a wood</div>
      <div class='line'>Which they frequented had been mark’d by blood;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, though she thought her Robert was secure</div>
      <div class='line'>In better thoughts, yet could she not be sure.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James now was urgent—it would break his heart</div>
      <div class='line'>With hope, with her, and with such views to part,</div>
      <div class='line'>When one so wicked would her hand possess,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he a brother!—that was his distress,      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And must be hers——She heard him, and she sigh’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Looking in doubt—but nothing she replied.</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a generous feeling in her mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>That told her this was neither good nor kind.</div>
      <div class='line'>James caused her terror, but he did no more—</div>
      <div class='line'>Her love was now as it had been before.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Their traffic fail’d—and the adventurous crew</div>
      <div class='line'>No more their profitless attempts renew.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dig they will not, and beg they might in vain—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Had they not pride, and what can then remain?      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now was the game destroy’d, and not an hare</div>
      <div class='line'>Escaped at least the danger of the snare;</div>
      <div class='line'>Woods of their feather’d beauty were bereft,</div>
      <div class='line'>The beauteous victims of the silent theft;</div>
      <div class='line'>The well-known shops received a large supply,</div>
      <div class='line'>That they who could not kill at least might buy.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James was enraged, enraged his lord, and both</div>
      <div class='line'>Confirm’d their threatening with a vengeful oath;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fresh aid was sought,—and nightly on the lands</div>
      <div class='line'>Walk’d on their watch the strong determined bands:      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Pardon was offer’d, and a promised pay</div>
      <div class='line'>To him who would the desperate gang betray.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nor fail’d the measure—on a certain night</div>
      <div class='line'>A few were seized—the rest escaped by flight;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet they resisted boldly ere they fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>And blows were dealt around, and blood was shed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Two groaning helpers on the earth were laid,</div>
      <div class='line'>When more arrived the lawful cause to aid;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then four determined men were seized and bound,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Robert in this desperate number found.      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In prison fetter’d, he deplored his fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cursed the folly he perceived too late.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James was a favourite with his lord—the zeal</div>
      <div class='line'>He show’d was such as masters ever feel;</div>
      <div class='line'>If he for vengeance on a culprit cried,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or if for mercy, still his lord complied;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now, ’twas said, he will for mercy plead,</div>
      <div class='line'>For his own brother’s was the guilty deed;</div>
      <div class='line'>True, the hurt man is in a mending way,</div>
      <div class='line'>But must be crippled to his dying day.      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now James had vow’d the law should take its course,</div>
      <div class='line'>He would not stay it, if he did not force;</div>
      <div class='line'>He could his witness, if he pleased, withdraw,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or he could arm with certain death the law.</div>
      <div class='line'>This he attested to the maid; and true,</div>
      <div class='line'>If this he could not, yet he much could do.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How suffer’d then that maid—no thought she had,</div>
      <div class='line'>No view of days to come, that was not sad:</div>
      <div class='line'>As sad as life with all its hopes resign’d,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>As sad as ought but guilt can make mankind.      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>With bitter grief the pleasures she review’d      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of early hope, with innocence pursued,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When she began to love, and he was fond and good.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He now must die, she heard from every tongue—</div>
      <div class='line'>Die, and so thoughtless! perish, and so young!</div>
      <div class='line'>Brave, kind, and generous, tender, constant, true,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he must die—then will I perish too!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A thousand acts in every age will prove</div>
      <div class='line'>Women are valiant in a cause they love;</div>
      <div class='line'>If fate the favour’d swain in danger place,      <span class='linenum'>310}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They heed not danger—perils they embrace;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They dare the world’s contempt, they brave their name’s disgrace;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They on the ocean meet its wild alarms;</div>
      <div class='line'>They search the dungeon with extended arms;</div>
      <div class='line'>The utmost trial of their faith they prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yield the lover to assert their love.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James knew his power—his feelings were not nice—</div>
      <div class='line'>Mercy he sold, and she must pay the price:</div>
      <div class='line'>If his good lord forbore to urge their fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he the utmost of their guilt to state,      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The felons might their forfeit lives redeem.</div>
      <div class='line'>And in their country’s cause regain esteem;</div>
      <div class='line'>But never more that man, whom he had shame</div>
      <div class='line'>To call his brother, must she see or name.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Rachel was meek, but she had firmness too,</div>
      <div class='line'>And reason’d much on what she ought to do.</div>
      <div class='line'>In Robert’s place, she knew what she should choose—</div>
      <div class='line'>But life was not the thing she fear’d to lose.</div>
      <div class='line'>She knew that she could not their contract break,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor for her life a new engagement make;      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But he was man, and guilty—death so near</div>
      <div class='line'>Might not to his as to her mind appear;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he might wish, to spare that forfeit life.</div>
      <div class='line'>The maid he loved might be his brother’s wife,</div>
      <div class='line'>Although that brother was his bitter foe,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he must all the sweets of life forego.</div>
      <div class='line'>This would she try—intent on this alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>She could assume a calm and settled tone;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>She spake with firmness—“I will Robert see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Know what he wishes, and what I must be;”      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For James had now discover’d to the maid</div>
      <div class='line'>His inmost heart, and how he must be paid,</div>
      <div class='line'>If he his lord would soften, and would hide</div>
      <div class='line'>The facts that must the culprit’s fate decide.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Go not,” he said—for she her full intent</div>
      <div class='line'>Proclaime’d——To go she purposed, and she went;</div>
      <div class='line'>She took a guide, and went with purpose stern</div>
      <div class='line'>The secret wishes of her friend to learn.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She saw him fetter’d, full of grief, alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still as the dead, and he suppress’d a groan      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At her appearance——Now she pray’d for strength,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the sad couple could converse at length.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It was a scene that shook her to repeat—</div>
      <div class='line'>Life fought with love, both powerful, and both sweet.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Wilt thou die, Robert, or preserve thy life?</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall I be thine own maid, or James’s wife?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“His wife!—No!—Never will I thee resign—</div>
      <div class='line'>No, Rachel, no!”——“Then am I ever thine:</div>
      <div class='line'>I know thee rash and guilty—but to thee</div>
      <div class='line'>I pledged my vow, and thine will ever be.      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet think again—the life that God has lent</div>
      <div class='line'>Is thine, but not to cast away—Consent,</div>
      <div class='line'>If ’tis thy wish; for this I made my way</div>
      <div class='line'>To thy distress—Command, and I obey.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Perhaps my brother may have gain’d thy heart?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>Then why this visit, if I wish’d to part?</div>
      <div class='line'>Was it, ah, man ungrateful! wise to make</div>
      <div class='line'>Effort like this, to hazard for thy sake</div>
      <div class='line'>A spotless reputation, and to be</div>
      <div class='line'>A suppliant to that stern man for thee?      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But I forgive—thy spirit has been tried,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou art weak; but still thou must decide.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I ask’d thy brother, ‘James, would’st thou command,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without the loving heart, the obedient hand?’</div>
      <div class='line'>I ask thee, Robert, lover, canst thou part</div>
      <div class='line'>With this poor hand, when master of the heart?</div>
      <div class='line'>He answer’d, ‘Yes!’—I tarry thy reply,</div>
      <div class='line'>Resign’d with him to live, content with thee to die.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Assured of this, with spirits low and tame:</div>
      <div class='line'>Here, life so purchased—there, a death of shame;      <span class='linenum'>380&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Death, once his merriment, but now his dread—</div>
      <div class='line'>And he with terror thought upon the dead:</div>
      <div class='line'>“[Oh]! sure ’tis better to endure the care</div>
      <div class='line'>And pain of life, than go we know not where!—</div>
      <div class='line'>And is there not the dreaded hell for sin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or is it only this I feel within,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, if it lasted, no man would sustain,</div>
      <div class='line'>But would by any change relieve the pain?</div>
      <div class='line'>Forgive me, love! it is a loathsome thing      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To live not thine; but still this dreaded sting      <span class='linenum'>390}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of death torments me—I to nature cling——      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Go, and be his—but love him not, be sure—</div>
      <div class='line'>Go, love him not—and I will life endure:</div>
      <div class='line'>He, too, is mortal!”——Rachel deeply sigh’d,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But would no more converse: she had complied,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And was no longer free—she was his brother’s bride.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Farewell!” she said, with kindness, but not fond,</div>
      <div class='line'>Feeling the pressure of the recent bond,</div>
      <div class='line'>And put her tenderness apart to give</div>
      <div class='line'>Advice to one who so desired to live.      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She then departed, join’d the attending guide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Reflected—wept—was sad—was satisfied.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James on her worth and virtue could depend—</div>
      <div class='line'>He listen’d gladly to her story’s end;</div>
      <div class='line'>Again he promised Robert’s life to save,</div>
      <div class='line'>And claim’d the hand that she in payment gave.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Robert, when death no longer was in view,</div>
      <div class='line'>Scorn’d what was done, but could not this undo.</div>
      <div class='line'>The day appointed for the trial near</div>
      <div class='line'>He view’d with shame, and not unmix’d with fear:—      <span class='linenum'>410&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>James might deceive him; and, if not, the schemes</div>
      <div class='line'>Of men may fail——“Can I depend on James?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He might; for now the grievous price was paid—</div>
      <div class='line'>James to the altar led the victim maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gave the trembling girl his faithful word</div>
      <div class='line'>For Robert’s safety; and so gave my lord.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But this, and all the promise hope could give,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gilded not life—it was not joy to live;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>There was no smile in Rachel, nothing gay;</div>
      <div class='line'>The hours pass’d off, but never danced away.      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>When drew the gloomy day for trial near</div>
      <div class='line'>There came a note to Robert—“Banish fear!”</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew whence safety came—his terror fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>But rage and vengeance fill’d his soul instead.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A stronger fear in his companions rose—</div>
      <div class='line'>The day of trial on their hopes might close:</div>
      <div class='line'>They had no brothers, none to intercede</div>
      <div class='line'>For them, their friends suspected, and in need;</div>
      <div class='line'>Scatter’d, they judged, and could unite no more—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not so, they then were at the prison door.      <span class='linenum'>430&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>For some had met who sought the haunts they loved,</div>
      <div class='line'>And were to pity and to vengeance moved:</div>
      <div class='line'>Their fellows perish! and they see their fall—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Why not attempt the steep but guardless wall?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Attempt was made, his part assign’d each man,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they succeeded in the desperate plan;</div>
      <div class='line'>In truth, a purposed mercy smooth’d their way,</div>
      <div class='line'>But that they knew not—all triumphant they.</div>
      <div class='line'>Safe in their well-known haunts, they all prepared</div>
      <div class='line'>To plan anew, and show how much they dared.      <span class='linenum'>440&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>With joy the troubled heart of Robert beat,</div>
      <div class='line'>For life was his, and liberty was sweet;</div>
      <div class='line'>He look’d around in freedom——in delight?</div>
      <div class='line'>O! no—his Rachel was another’s right!</div>
      <div class='line'>“Right!—has he then preserved me in the day</div>
      <div class='line'>Of my distress?—He has the lovely pay,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I no freedom at the [slave’s] request!</div>
      <div class='line'>The price I paid shall then be repossess’d!</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! her virtue and the law prevent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Force cannot be, and she will not consent;      <span class='linenum'>450&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But were that brother gone!—A brother?  No!</div>
      <div class='line'>A circumventor!—and the wretch shall go!</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet not this hand—How shifts about my mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ungovern’d, guideless, drifting in the wind;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I am all a tempest, whirl’d around</div>
      <div class='line'>By dreadful thoughts, that fright me and confound!—</div>
      <div class='line'>I would I saw him on the earth laid low!</div>
      <div class='line'>I wish the fate, but must not give the blow!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>So thinks a man when thoughtful; he prefers</div>
      <div class='line'>A life of peace till man his anger stirs;      <span class='linenum'>460&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then all the efforts of his reason cease,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he forgets how pleasant was that peace;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the wild passions what they seek obtain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then he sinks into his calm again.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now met the lawless clan—in secret met,</div>
      <div class='line'>And down at their convivial board were set;</div>
      <div class='line'>The plans in view to past adventures led,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And the past conflicts present anger bred;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They sigh’d for pleasures gone, they groan’d for heroes dead;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Their ancient stores were rifled—strong desires      <span class='linenum'>470&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Awaked, and wine rekindled latent fires.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It was a night such bold desires to move:</div>
      <div class='line'>Strong winds and wintry torrents fill’d the grove;</div>
      <div class='line'>The crackling boughs that in the forest fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>The cawing rooks, the cur’s affrighten’d yell,</div>
      <div class='line'>The scenes above the wood, the floods below,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Were mix’d, and none the single sound could know;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Loud blow the blasts,” they cried, “and call us as they blow.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“In such a night”—and then the heroes told</div>
      <div class='line'>What had been done in better times of old:      <span class='linenum'>480&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>How they had conquer’d all opposed to them,</div>
      <div class='line'>By force in part, in part by stratagem;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as the tales inflamed the fiery crew,</div>
      <div class='line'>What had been done they then prepared to do;</div>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis a last night!” they said—the angry blast</div>
      <div class='line'>And roaring floods seem’d answering, “’tis a last!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James knew they met, for he had spies about,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grave, sober men, whom none presumed to doubt;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, if suspected, they had soon been tried</div>
      <div class='line'>Where fears are evidence, and doubts decide.      <span class='linenum'>490&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But these escaped——Now James companions took,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sturdy and bold, with terror-stirring look;</div>
      <div class='line'>He had before, by informations led,</div>
      <div class='line'>Left the afflicted partner of his bed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Awaked his men, and through plantations wide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Deep woods, and trackless ling, had been their guide;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then return’d to wake the pitying wife,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>And hear her tender terrors for his life.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But in this night a sure informer came:</div>
      <div class='line'>“They were assembled who attack’d his game;      <span class='linenum'>500&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who more than once had through the park made way,</div>
      <div class='line'>And slain the dappled breed, or vow’d to slay;”</div>
      <div class='line'>The trembling spy had heard the solemn vow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And need and vengeance both inspired them now.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The keeper early had retired to rest</div>
      <div class='line'>For brief repose;—sad thoughts his mind possess’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>In his short sleep he started from his bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ask’d in fancy’s terror “Is he dead?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There was a call below, when James awoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose from his bed, and arms to aid him took,      <span class='linenum'>510&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Not all defensive!—there his helpers stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Arm’d like himself, and hastening to the wood.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Why this?” he said, for Rachel pour’d her tears</div>
      <div class='line'>Profuse, that spoke involuntary fears:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Sleep, that so early thou for us may’st wake,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we our comforts in return may take;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sleep, and farewell!” he said, and took his way,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the sad wife in neither could obey.</div>
      <div class='line'>She slept not nor well fared, but restless dwelt</div>
      <div class='line'>On her past life, and past afflictions felt;      <span class='linenum'>520&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The man she loved the brother and the foe</div>
      <div class='line'>Of him she married!—It had wrought her woe:</div>
      <div class='line'>Not that she loved, but pitied, and that now</div>
      <div class='line'>Was, so she fear’d, infringement of her vow.</div>
      <div class='line'>James too was civil, though she must confess</div>
      <div class='line'>That his was not her kind of happiness;</div>
      <div class='line'>That he would shoot the man who shot a hare</div>
      <div class='line'>Was what her timid conscience could not bear;</div>
      <div class='line'>But still she loved him—wonder’d where he stray’d</div>
      <div class='line'>In this loud night! and if he were afraid.      <span class='linenum'>530&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>More than one hour she thought, and, dropping then,</div>
      <div class='line'>In sudden sleep, cried loudly “Spare him, men!</div>
      <div class='line'>And do no murder!”—then, awaked, she rose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thought no more of trying for repose.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>’Twas past the dead of night; when every sound</div>
      <div class='line'>That nature mingles might be heard around;</div>
      <div class='line'>But none from man—man’s feeble voice was hush’d,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Where rivers swelling roar’d, and woods were crush’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hurried by these, the wife could sit no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>But must the terrors of the night explore.      <span class='linenum'>540&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Softly she left her door, her garden gate,</div>
      <div class='line'>And seem’d as then committed to her fate;</div>
      <div class='line'>To every horrid thought and doubt a prey,</div>
      <div class='line'>She hurried on, already lost her way;</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft as she glided on in that sad night,</div>
      <div class='line'>She stopp’d to listen, and she look’d for light.</div>
      <div class='line'>An hour she wander’d, and was still to learn</div>
      <div class='line'>Aught of her husband’s safety or return:</div>
      <div class='line'>A sudden break of heavy clouds could show</div>
      <div class='line'>A place she knew not, but she strove to know.      <span class='linenum'>550&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Still further on she crept with trembling feet,</div>
      <div class='line'>With hope a friend, with fear a foe, to meet;</div>
      <div class='line'>And there was something fearful in the sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in the sound of what appear’d to-night;</div>
      <div class='line'>For now, of night and nervous terror bred,</div>
      <div class='line'>Arose a strong and superstitious dread;</div>
      <div class='line'>She heard strange noises, and the shapes she saw</div>
      <div class='line'>Of fancied beings bound her soul in awe.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The moon was risen, and she sometimes shone</div>
      <div class='line'>Through thick white clouds, that flew tumultuous on,      <span class='linenum'>560&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Passing beneath her with an eagle’s speed,</div>
      <div class='line'>That her soft light imprisoned and then freed;</div>
      <div class='line'>The fitful glimmering through the hedge-row green</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave a strange beauty to the changing scene;</div>
      <div class='line'>And roaring winds and rushing waters lent</div>
      <div class='line'>Their mingled voice that to the spirit went.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To these she listen’d; but new sounds were heard,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sight more startling to her soul appear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>There were low, lengthen’d tones with sobs between,</div>
      <div class='line'>And near at hand, but nothing yet was seen;      <span class='linenum'>570&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She hurried on, and “Who is there?” she cried;</div>
      <div class='line'>“A dying wretch!”—was from the earth replied.</div>
      <div class='line'>It was her lover, was the man she gave—</div>
      <div class='line'>The price she paid, himself from death to save—</div>
      <div class='line'>With whom, expiring, she must kneel and pray,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>While the soul flitted from the shivering clay      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That press’d the dewy ground, and bled its life away!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>This was the part that duty bad her take,</div>
      <div class='line'>Instant and ere her feelings were awake;</div>
      <div class='line'>But now they waked to anguish; there came then,      <span class='linenum'>580&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Hurrying with lights, loud-speaking, eager men.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And here, my lord, we met—And who is here?</div>
      <div class='line'>The keeper’s wife—Ah! woman, go not near!</div>
      <div class='line'>There lies the man that was the head of all—</div>
      <div class='line'>See, in his temples went the fatal ball!</div>
      <div class='line'>And James that instant, who was then our guide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Felt in his heart the adverse shot, and died!</div>
      <div class='line'>It was a sudden meeting, and the light</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a dull moon made indistinct our fight;</div>
      <div class='line'>He foremost fell!—But see, the woman creeps      <span class='linenum'>590&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Like a lost thing, that wanders as she sleeps.</div>
      <div class='line'>See here, her husband’s body—but she knows</div>
      <div class='line'>That other dead! and that her action shows.</div>
      <div class='line'>Rachel! why look you at your mortal foe?—</div>
      <div class='line'>She does not hear us—Whither will she go?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now, more attentive, on the dead they gazed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they were brothers: sorrowing and amazed,</div>
      <div class='line'>On all a momentary silence came,</div>
      <div class='line'>A common softness, and a moral shame.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Seized you the poachers?” said my lord—“They fled,      <span class='linenum'>600&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And we pursued not—one of them was dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>And one of us; they hurried through the wood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Two lives were gone, and we no more pursued.</div>
      <div class='line'>Two lives of men, of valiant brothers lost!</div>
      <div class='line'>Enough, my lord, do hares and pheasants cost!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So many thought, and there is found a heart</div>
      <div class='line'>To dwell upon the deaths on either part;</div>
      <div class='line'>Since this their morals have been more correct,</div>
      <div class='line'>The cruel spirit in the place is check’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>His lordship holds not in such sacred care,      <span class='linenum'>610&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor takes such dreadful vengeance for a hare;</div>
      <div class='line'>The smugglers fear, the poacher stands in awe</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Heaven’s own act, and reverences the law;</div>
      <div class='line'>There was, there is a terror in the place</div>
      <div class='line'>That operates on man’s offending race;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such acts will stamp their moral on the soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>And while the bad they threaten and control,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Will to the pious and the humble say,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yours is the right, the safe, the certain way,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis wisdom to be good, ’tis virtue to obey.      <span class='linenum'>620}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>So Rachel thinks, the pure, the good, the meek,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose outward acts the inward purpose speak.</div>
      <div class='line'>As men will children at their sports behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And smile to see them, though unmoved and cold;</div>
      <div class='line'>Smile at the recollected games, and then</div>
      <div class='line'>Depart and mix in the affairs of men:</div>
      <div class='line'>So Rachel looks upon the world, and sees</div>
      <div class='line'>It cannot longer pain her, longer please,</div>
      <div class='line'>But just detain the passing thought, or cause</div>
      <div class='line'>A gentle smile of pity or applause;      <span class='linenum'>630&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And then the recollected soul repairs</div>
      <div class='line'>Her slumbering hope, and heeds her own affairs.</div>

      <div class='line'>Feeling and frankness—thus it seem’d to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And such farewell!—Well, Rector, let it be!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of the fair sisters then he took his leave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Forget he could not, he must think and grieve;</div>
      <div class='line'>Must the impression of their wrongs retain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their very patience adding to his pain;</div>
      <div class='line'>And still, the better they their sorrows bore,      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His friendly nature made him feel them more.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He judged they must have many a heavy hour</div>
      <div class='line'>When the mind suffers from a want of power;</div>
      <div class='line'>When, troubled long, we find our strength decay’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cannot then recal our better aid;</div>
      <div class='line'>For to the mind ere yet that aid has flown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grief has possess’d, and made it all his own;</div>
      <div class='line'>And patience suffers, till, with gather’d might,</div>
      <div class='line'>The scatter’d forces of the soul unite.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>But few and short such times of suffering were      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In Lucy’s mind, and brief the reign of care.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Jane had, indeed, her flights, but had in them</div>
      <div class='line'>What we could pity, but must not condemn;</div>
      <div class='line'>For they were always pure and oft sublime,</div>
      <div class='line'>And such as triumph’d over earth and time:</div>
      <div class='line'>Thoughts of eternal love that souls possess,</div>
      <div class='line'>Foretaste divine of Heaven’s own happiness.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oft had he seen them, and esteem had sprung</div>
      <div class='line'>In his free mind for maids so sad and young,</div>
      <div class='line'>So good and grieving, and his place was high      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In their esteem, his friendly brother’s nigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>But yet beneath; and when he said adieu!</div>
      <div class='line'>Their tone was kind, and was responsive too.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Parting was painful; when adieu he cried,</div>
      <div class='line'>“You will return?” the gentle girls replied;</div>
      <div class='line'>“You must return! your Brother knows you now,</div>
      <div class='line'>But to exist without you knows not how;</div>
      <div class='line'>Has he not told us of the lively joy</div>
      <div class='line'>He takes—forgive us—in the Brother-boy?</div>
      <div class='line'>He is alone and pensive; you can give      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Pleasure to one by whom a number live</div>
      <div class='line'>In daily comfort—sure for this you met,</div>
      <div class='line'>That for his debtors you might pay a debt—</div>
      <div class='line'>The poor are call’d ungrateful, but you still</div>
      <div class='line'>Will have their thanks for this—indeed you will.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Richard but little said, for he of late</div>
      <div class='line'>Held with himself contention and debate.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“My Brother loves me, his regard I know,</div>
      <div class='line'>But will not such affection weary grow?</div>
      <div class='line'>He kindly says, ‘defer the parting day,’      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But yet may wish me in his heart away;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nothing but kindness I in him perceive,</div>
      <div class='line'>In me ’tis kindness then to take my leave.</div>
      <div class='line'>Why should I grieve if he should weary be?</div>
      <div class='line'>There have been visitors who wearied me;</div>
      <div class='line'>He yet may love, and we may part in peace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, in affection—novelty must cease—</div>
      <div class='line'>Man is but man; the thing he most desires</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleases awhile—then pleases not—then tires;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>George to his former habits and his friends      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Will now return, and so my visit ends.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus Richard communed with his heart; but still</div>
      <div class='line'>He found opposed his reason and his will;</div>
      <div class='line'>Found that his thoughts were busy in this train,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he was striving to be calm in vain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>These thoughts were passing, while he yet forbore</div>
      <div class='line'>To leave the friends whom he might see no more.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then came a chubby child and sought relief,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sobbing in all the impotence of grief;</div>
      <div class='line'>A full-fed girl she was, with ruddy cheek,      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And features coarse, that grosser feelings speak,</div>
      <div class='line'>To whom another miss, with passions strong,</div>
      <div class='line'>And slender fist, had done some baby-wrong.</div>
      <div class='line'>On Lucy’s gentle mind had Barlow wrought</div>
      <div class='line'>To teach this child, whom she had labouring taught</div>
      <div class='line'>With unpaid love—this unproductive brain</div>
      <div class='line'>Would little comprehend, and less retain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A farmer’s daughter, with redundant health,</div>
      <div class='line'>And double Lucy’s weight and Lucy’s wealth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had won the man’s regard, and he with her      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Possess’d the treasure vulgar minds prefer.</div>
      <div class='line'>A man of thrift, and thriving, he possess’d</div>
      <div class='line'>What he esteem’d of earthly good the best;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Lucy’s well-stored mind had not a charm</div>
      <div class='line'>For this true lover of the well-stock’d farm,</div>
      <div class='line'>This slave to petty wealth and rustic toil,</div>
      <div class='line'>This earth-devoted wooer of the soil.—</div>
      <div class='line'>But she with meekness took the wayward child,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sought to make the savage nature mild.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But Jane her judgment with decision gave—      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Train not an idiot to oblige a slave.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And where is Bloomer?” Richard would have said,</div>
      <div class='line'>But he was cautious, feeling, and afraid;</div>
      <div class='line'>And little either of the hero knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And little sought—he might be married too.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now to his home, the morning visits past,</div>
      <div class='line'>Return’d the guest—that evening was his last.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He met his Brother, and they spoke of those</div>
      <div class='line'>From whom his comforts in the village rose;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Spoke of the favourites, whom so good and kind      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It was peculiar happiness to find;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then for the sisters in their griefs they felt,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, sad themselves, on saddening subjects dwelt.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But George was willing all this woe to spare,</div>
      <div class='line'>And let to-morrow be to-morrow’s care.</div>
      <div class='line'>He of his purchase talk’d—a thing of course,</div>
      <div class='line'>As men will boldly praise a new-bought horse.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Richard was not to all its beauty blind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And promised still to seek, with hope to find:</div>
      <div class='line'>The price indeed——”</div>
      <div class='line in18'>“Yes, that,” said George, “is high;      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But, if I bought not, one was sure to buy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who might the social comforts we enjoy,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every comfort, lessen or destroy.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“We must not always reckon what we give,</div>
      <div class='line'>But think how precious ’tis in peace to live;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some neighbour Nimrod might in very pride</div>
      <div class='line'>Have stirr’d my anger, and have then defied;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or worse, have loved, and teased me to excess</div>
      <div class='line'>By his kind care to give me happiness;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or might his lady and her daughters bring      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To raise my spirits, to converse, and sing.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas not the benefit alone I view’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>But thought what horrid things I might exclude.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Some party man might here have sat him down,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some country champion, railing at the crown;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or some true courtier, both prepared to prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who loved not them, could not their country love:</div>
      <div class='line'>If we have value for our health and ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>Should we not buy off enemies like these?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So pass’d the evening in a quiet way,      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When, lo! the morning of the parting day.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Each to the table went with clouded look,</div>
      <div class='line'>And George in silence gazed upon a book;</div>
      <div class='line'>Something that chance had offer’d to his view—</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew not what, or cared not, if he knew.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Richard his hand upon a paper laid—</div>
      <div class='line'>His vacant eye upon the carpet stray’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>His tongue was talking something of the day,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>And his vex’d mind was wandering on his way.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They spake by fits—but neither had concern      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In the replies—they nothing wish’d to learn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor to relate; each sat as one who tries</div>
      <div class='line'>To baffle sadnesses and sympathies.</div>
      <div class='line'>Each of his Brother took a steady view—</div>
      <div class='line'>As actor he, and as observer too.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Richard, whose heart was ever free and frank,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had now a trial, and before it sank:</div>
      <div class='line'>He thought his Brother—parting now so near—</div>
      <div class='line'>Appear’d not as his Brother should appear;</div>
      <div class='line'>He could as much of tenderness remark      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When parting for a ramble in the park.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Yet, is it just?” he thought; “and would I see</div>
      <div class='line'>My Brother wretched but to part with me?</div>
      <div class='line'>What can he further in my mind explore?</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw enough, and he would see no more.</div>
      <div class='line'>Happy himself, he wishes now to slide      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Back to his habits——He is satisfied;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But I am not—this cannot be denied.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“He has been kind—so let me think him still;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet he expresses not a wish, a will      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To meet again!”——And thus affection strove</div>
      <div class='line'>With pride, and petulance made war on love.</div>
      <div class='line'>He thought his Brother cool—he knew him kind—</div>
      <div class='line'>And there was sore division in his mind.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Hours yet remain—’tis misery to sit</div>
      <div class='line'>With minds for conversation all unfit;</div>
      <div class='line'>No evil can from change of place arise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And good will spring from air and exercise:</div>
      <div class='line'>Suppose I take the purposed ride with you,</div>
      <div class='line'>And guide your jaded praise to objects new,      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That buyers see?”——</div>
      <div class='line in20'>And Richard gave assent      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Without resistance, and without intent;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He liked not nor declined—and forth the Brothers went.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Come, my dear Richard! let us cast away      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>All evil thoughts—let us forget the day,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And fight like men with grief till we like boys are gay.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus George—and even this in Richard’s mind</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Was judged an effort rather wise than kind;</div>
      <div class='line'>This flow’d from something he observed of late,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he could feel it, but he could not state;      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He thought some change appear’d—yet fail’d to prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even as he tried, abatement in the love;</div>
      <div class='line'>But in his Brother’s manner was restraint</div>
      <div class='line'>That he could feel, and yet he could not paint.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That they should part in peace full well he knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>But much he fear’d to part with coolness too.</div>
      <div class='line'>George had been peevish when the subject rose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And never fail’d the parting to oppose;</div>
      <div class='line'>Name it, and straight his features cloudy grew</div>
      <div class='line'>To stop the journey as the clouds will do;—      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And thus they rode along in pensive mood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their thoughts pursuing, by their cares pursued.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Richard,” said George, “I see it is in vain</div>
      <div class='line'>By love or prayer my Brother to retain;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, truth to tell, it was a foolish thing</div>
      <div class='line'>A man like thee from thy repose to bring</div>
      <div class='line'>Ours to disturb——Say, how am I to live</div>
      <div class='line'>Without the comforts thou art wont to give?</div>
      <div class='line'>How will the heavy hours my mind afflict—</div>
      <div class='line'>No one t’ agree, no one to contradict;      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>None to awake, excite me, or prevent;</div>
      <div class='line'>To hear a tale, or hold an argument;</div>
      <div class='line'>To help my worship in a case of doubt,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bring me in my blunders fairly out.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Who now by manners lively or serene</div>
      <div class='line'>Comes between me and sorrow like a screen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And giving, what I look’d not to have found,</div>
      <div class='line'>A care, an interest in the world around?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Silent was Richard, striving to adjust</div>
      <div class='line'>His thoughts for speech—for speak, he thought, he must.      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Something like war within his bosom strove—</div>
      <div class='line'>His mild, kind nature, and his proud self-love;</div>
      <div class='line'>Grateful he was, and with his courage meek—</div>
      <div class='line'>But he was hurt, and he resolved to speak.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Yes, my dear Brother! from my soul I grieve</div>
      <div class='line'>Thee and the proofs of thy regard to leave.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou hast been all that I could wish—my pride</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Exults to find that I am thus allied;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, to express a feeling—how it came,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pain it gives, its nature and its name,      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I know not—but of late, I will confess,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not that thy love is little, but is less.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Hadst thou received me in thy present mood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sure I had held thee to be kind and good;</div>
      <div class='line'>But thou wert all the warmest heart could state,</div>
      <div class='line'>Affection dream, or hope anticipate;</div>
      <div class='line'>I must have wearied thee yet day by day—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Stay!’ said my Brother, and ’twas good to stay;</div>
      <div class='line'>But now, forgive me, thinking I perceive</div>
      <div class='line'>Change undefined, and as I think I grieve.      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Have I offended?—Proud although I be,</div>
      <div class='line'>I will be humble, and concede to thee.</div>
      <div class='line'>Have I intruded on thee when thy mind</div>
      <div class='line'>Was vex’d, and then to solitude inclined?</div>
      <div class='line'>O! there are times when all things will molest</div>
      <div class='line'>Minds so disposed, so heavy, so oppress’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thine, I know, is delicate and nice,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sickening at folly, and at war with vice:</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, at a time when thou wert vex’d with these,</div>
      <div class='line'>I have intruded, let affection tease,      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And so offended.”——</div>
      <div class='line in20'>“Richard, if thou hast,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis at this instant, nothing in the past.</div>
      <div class='line'>No, thou art all a Brother’s love would choose;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, having lost thee, I shall interest lose</div>
      <div class='line'>In all that I possess; I pray thee tell</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherein thy host has fail’d to please thee well—</div>
      <div class='line'>Do I neglect thy comforts?”—</div>
      <div class='line in28'>“O! not thou,</div>
      <div class='line'>But art thyself uncomfortable now;</div>
      <div class='line'>And ’tis from thee and from thy looks I gain</div>
      <div class='line'>This painful knowledge—’tis my Brother’s pain;      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And yet, that something in my spirit lives,</div>
      <div class='line'>Something that spleen excites and sorrow gives,</div>
      <div class='line'>I may confess—for not in thee I trace</div>
      <div class='line'>Alone this change, it is in all the place.</div>
      <div class='line'>Smile if thou wilt in scorn, for I am glad</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>A smile at any rate is to be had.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But there is Jacques, who ever seem’d to treat</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy Brother kindly as we chanced to meet;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor with thee only pleased our worthy guide,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, in the hedge-row path and green-wood side,      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There he would speak with that familiar ease</div>
      <div class='line'>That makes a trifle, makes a nothing please.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But now to my farewell—and that I spoke</div>
      <div class='line'>With honest sorrow—with a careless look,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gazing unalter’d on some stupid prose—</div>
      <div class='line'>His sermon for the Sunday I suppose—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Going?’ said he: ‘why then the ’Squire and you</div>
      <div class='line'>Will part at last—You’re going?—Well, adieu!’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“True, we were not in friendship bound like those</div>
      <div class='line'>Who will adopt each other’s friends and foes,      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Without esteem or hatred of their own—</div>
      <div class='line'>But still we were to intimacy grown;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, sure, of Jacques when I had taken leave</div>
      <div class='line'>It would have grieved me—and it ought to grieve;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I in him could not affection trace—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Careless he put his sermons in their place,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With no more feeling than his sermon-case.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Not so those generous girls beyond the brook—</div>
      <div class='line'>It quite unmann’d me as my leave I took.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But, my dear Brother! when I take at night,      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In my own home and in their mother’s sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>By turns my children, or together see</div>
      <div class='line'>A pair contending for the vacant knee;</div>
      <div class='line'>When to Matilda I begin to tell</div>
      <div class='line'>What in my visit first and last befell—</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this your village, of her tower and spire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, above all, her Rector and her ‘Squire,</div>
      <div class='line'>How will the tale be marr’d when I shall end—</div>
      <div class='line'>I left displeased the Brother and the friend?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Nay, Jacques is honest—Marry, he was then      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Engaged—What! part an author and his pen?</div>
      <div class='line'>Just in the fit, and when th’ inspiring ray</div>
      <div class='line'>Shot on his brain, t’ arrest it in its way!</div>
      <div class='line'>Come, thou shalt see him in an easier vein,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor of his looks nor of his words complain;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Art thou content?”—</div>
      <div class='line in20'>If Richard had replied,</div>
      <div class='line'>“I am,” his manner had his words belied.</div>
      <div class='line'>Even from his Brother’s cheerfulness he drew</div>
      <div class='line'>Something to vex him—what, he scarcely knew;</div>
      <div class='line'>So he evading said, “My evil fate      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Upon my comforts throws a gloom of late:</div>
      <div class='line'>Matilda writes not; and, when last she wrote,</div>
      <div class='line'>I read no letter—’twas a trader’s note—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Yours I received,’ and all that formal prate</div>
      <div class='line'>That is so hateful, that she knows I hate.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Dejection reigns, I feel, but cannot tell</div>
      <div class='line'>Why upon me the dire infection fell.</div>
      <div class='line'>Madmen may say that they alone are sane,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all beside have a distemper’d brain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Something like this I feel—and I include      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Myself among the frantic multitude;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, come, Matilda writes, although but ill,</div>
      <div class='line'>And home has health, and that is comfort still.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>George stopt his horse, and with the kindest look</div>
      <div class='line'>Spoke to his Brother—earnestly he spoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>As one who to his friend his heart reveals.</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the hazard with the comfort feels.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Soon as I loved thee, Richard—and I loved</div>
      <div class='line'>Before my reason had the will approved,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who yet right early had her sanction lent,      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And with affection in her verdict went—</div>
      <div class='line'>So soon I felt, that thus a friend to gain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then to lose, is but to purchase pain.</div>
      <div class='line'>Daily the pleasure grew, then sad the day</div>
      <div class='line'>That takes it all in its increase away!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Patient thou wert, and kind—but well I knew      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The husband’s wishes, and the father’s too;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I saw how check’d they were, and yet in secret grew.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Once and again, I urged thee to delay</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy purposed journey, still deferr’d the day;      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And still on its approach the pain increased</div>
      <div class='line'>Till my request and thy compliance ceased.</div>
      <div class='line'>I could not further thy affection task,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor more of one so self-resisting ask;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>But yet to lose thee, Richard, and with thee</div>
      <div class='line'>All hope of social joys—it cannot be.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor could I bear to meet thee, as a boy      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>From school his parents, to obtain a joy,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That lessens day by day, and one will soon destroy.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“No! I would have thee, Brother, all my own,      <span class='linenum'>380&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To grow beside me as my trees have grown:</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever near me, pleasant in my sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, in my mind, my pride and my delight.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Yet will I tell thee, Richard: had I found</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy mind dependent and thy heart unsound;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hadst thou been poor, obsequious, and disposed</div>
      <div class='line'>With any wish or measure to have closed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Willing on me, and gladly, to attend,</div>
      <div class='line'>The younger brother, the convenient friend:</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy speculation its reward had made      <span class='linenum'>390&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Like other ventures—thou hadst gain’d in trade.</div>
      <div class='line'>What reason urged, or Jacques esteem’d thy due,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thine had it been, and I, a trader too,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had paid my debt, and home my Brother sent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor glad nor sorry that he came or went;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who to his wife and children would have told,</div>
      <div class='line'>They had an uncle, and the man was old;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till every girl and boy had learn’d to prate</div>
      <div class='line'>Of uncle George, his gout, and his estate.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Thus had we parted; but as now thou art,      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I must not lose thee—No! I cannot part;</div>
      <div class='line'>Is it in human nature to consent,</div>
      <div class='line'>To give up all the good that heaven has lent,</div>
      <div class='line'>All social ease and comfort to forego,</div>
      <div class='line'>And live again the solitary? No!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“We part no more, dear Richard! thou wilt need</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy Brother’s help to teach thy boys to read;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I should love to hear Matilda’s psalm,</div>
      <div class='line'>To keep my spirit in a morning calm,</div>
      <div class='line'>And feel the soft devotion that prepares      <span class='linenum'>410&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The soul to rise above its earthly cares.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then thou and I, an independent two,</div>
      <div class='line'>May have our parties, and defend them too;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy liberal notions, and my loyal fears,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Will give us subjects for our future years;</div>
      <div class='line'>We will for truth alone contend and read,</div>
      <div class='line'>And our good Jacques shall oversee our creed.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Such were my views; and I had quickly made</div>
      <div class='line'>Some bold attempts my Brother to persuade</div>
      <div class='line'>To think as I did; but I knew too well      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Whose now thou wert, with whom thou wert to dwell;</div>
      <div class='line'>And why, I said, return him doubtful home,</div>
      <div class='line'>Six months to argue if he then would come</div>
      <div class='line'>Some six months after? and, beside, I know</div>
      <div class='line'>That all the happy are of course the slow;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou at home art happy, there wilt stay,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Dallying ’twixt will and will-not many a day,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And fret the gloss of hope, and hope itself, away.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Jacques is my friend; to him I gave my heart:</div>
      <div class='line'>‘You see my Brother, see I would not part;      <span class='linenum'>430&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Wilt thou an embassy of love disdain?</div>
      <div class='line'>Go to this sister, and my views explain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Gloss o’er my failings; paint me with a grace</div>
      <div class='line'>That Love beholds; put meaning in my face;</div>
      <div class='line'>Describe that dwelling; talk how well we live,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all its glory to our village give;</div>
      <div class='line'>Praise the kind sisters whom we love so much,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thine own virtues like an artist touch.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘Tell her, and here my secret purpose show,</div>
      <div class='line'>That no dependence shall my sister know;      <span class='linenum'>440&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Hers all the freedom that she loves shall be,</div>
      <div class='line'>And mine the debt—then press her to agree;</div>
      <div class='line'>Say, that my Brother’s wishes wait on hers,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his affection what she wills prefers.’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Forgive me, Brother—these my words and more</div>
      <div class='line'>Our friendly Rector to Matilda bore;</div>
      <div class='line'>At large, at length, were all my views explain’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to my joy my wishes I obtain’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Dwell in that house, and we shall still be near,</div>
      <div class='line'>Absence and parting I no more shall fear;      <span class='linenum'>450&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Dwell in thy home, and at thy will exclude</div>
      <div class='line'>All who shall dare upon thee to intrude.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Again thy pardon—’twas not my design</div>
      <div class='line'>To give surprise; a better view was mine;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>But let it pass—and yet I wish’d to see</div>
      <div class='line'>That meeting too; and happy may it be!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus George had spoken, and then look’d around,</div>
      <div class='line'>And smiled as one who then his road had found;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Follow!” he cried, and briskly urged his horse.</div>
      <div class='line'>Richard was puzzled, but obey’d of course;      <span class='linenum'>460&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He was affected like a man astray,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lost, but yet knowing something of the way;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till, a wood clear’d, that still conceal’d the view,</div>
      <div class='line'>Richard the purchase of his Brother knew;</div>
      <div class='line'>And something flash’d upon his mind not clear,</div>
      <div class='line'>But much with pleasure mix’d, in part with fear.</div>
      <div class='line'>As one who, wandering through a stormy night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sees his own home, and gladdens at the sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet feels some doubt if fortune had decreed</div>
      <div class='line'>That lively pleasure in such time of need:      <span class='linenum'>470&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So Richard felt—but now the mansion came</div>
      <div class='line'>In view direct—he knew it for the same;</div>
      <div class='line'>There too the garden walk, the elms design’d</div>
      <div class='line'>To guard the peaches from the eastern wind;</div>
      <div class='line'>And there the sloping glass, that when he shines</div>
      <div class='line'>Gives the sun’s vigour to the ripening vines.—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“It is my Brother’s!”—</div>
      <div class='line in24'>“No!” he answers, “No!</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis to thy own possession that we go;</div>
      <div class='line'>It is thy wife’s, and will thy children’s be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Earth, wood, and water!—all for thine and thee;      <span class='linenum'>480&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Bought in thy name—Alight, my friend, and come,</div>
      <div class='line'>I do beseech thee, to thy proper home;</div>
      <div class='line'>There wilt thou soon thy own Matilda view;</div>
      <div class='line'>She knows our deed, and she approves it too;</div>
      <div class='line'>Before her all our views and plans were laid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Jacques was there t’ explain and to persuade.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here, on this lawn, thy boys and girls shall run,</div>
      <div class='line'>And play their gambols when their tasks are done;</div>
      <div class='line'>There, from that window, shall their mother view</div>
      <div class='line'>The happy tribe, and smile at all they do;      <span class='linenum'>490&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>While thou, more gravely, hiding thy delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shalt cry ‘O! childish!’ and enjoy the sight.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“Well, my dear Richard, there’s no more to say—</div>
      <div class='line'>Stay, as you will—do any thing—but stay;</div>
      <div class='line'>Be, I dispute not, steward—what you will,</div>
      <div class='line'>Take your own name, but be my Brother still.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And hear me, Richard! if I should offend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Assume the patron, and forget the friend;</div>
      <div class='line'>If aught in word or manner I express</div>
      <div class='line'>That only touches on thy happiness;      <span class='linenum'>500&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>If I be peevish, humorsome, unkind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Spoil’d as I am by each subservient mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>For I am humour’d by a tribe who make</div>
      <div class='line'>Me more capricious for the pains they take</div>
      <div class='line'>To make me quiet; shouldst thou ever feel</div>
      <div class='line'>A wound from this, this leave not time to heal,</div>
      <div class='line'>But let thy wife her cheerful smile withhold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let her be civil, distant, cautious, cold;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then shall I woo forgiveness, and repent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor bear to lose the blessings Heaven has lent.”      <span class='linenum'>510&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But this was needless—there was joy of heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>All felt the good that all desired t’ impart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Respect, affection, and esteem combined,</div>
      <div class='line'>In sundry portions ruled in every mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er the whole an unobtrusive air</div>
      <div class='line'>Of pious joy, that urged the silent prayer,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bless’d the new-born feelings——Here we close</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>W</span>ithin a village, many a mile from town,</div>
      <div class='line'>A place of small resort and no renown—</div>
      <div class='line'>Save that it form’d a way, and gave a name</div>
      <div class='line'>To <span class='sc'>Silford Hall</span>, it made no claim to fame—</div>
      <div class='line'>It was the gain of some, the pride of all,</div>
      <div class='line'>That travellers stopt to ask for <span class='sc'>Silford Hall</span>.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Small as it was, the place could boast a School,</div>
      <div class='line'>In which Nathaniel Perkin bore the rule.</div>
      <div class='line'>Not mark’d for learning deep, or talents rare,</div>
      <div class='line'>But for his varying tasks and ceaseless care,      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Some forty boys, the sons of thrifty men,</div>
      <div class='line'>He taught to read, and part to use the pen;</div>
      <div class='line'>While, by more studious care, a favourite few      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Increased his pride—for, if the Scholar knew      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Enough for praise, say what the Teacher’s due?—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>These to his presence, slates in hand, moved on,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a grim smile their feats in figures won.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This Man of Letters woo’d in early life</div>
      <div class='line'>The Vicar’s maiden, whom he made his wife.</div>
      <div class='line'>She too can read, as by her song she proves—      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The song Nathaniel made about their loves.</div>
      <div class='line'>Five rosy girls, and one fair boy, increased</div>
      <div class='line'>The Father’s care, whose labours seldom ceased.</div>
      <div class='line'>No day of rest was his. If, now and then,</div>
      <div class='line'>His boys for play laid by the book and pen,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>For Lawyer Slow there was some deed to write,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or some young farmer’s letter to indite,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or land to measure, or, with legal skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>To frame some yeoman’s widow’s peevish will;</div>
      <div class='line'>And on the Sabbath—when his neighbours drest      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To hear their duties, and to take their rest—</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, when the Vicar’s periods ceased to flow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was heard Nathaniel, in his seat below.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such were his labours; but the time is come</div>
      <div class='line'>When his son Peter clears the hours of gloom,</div>
      <div class='line'>And brings him aid: though yet a boy, he shares</div>
      <div class='line'>In staid Nathaniel’s multifarious cares.</div>
      <div class='line'>A king his father, he, a prince, has rule—</div>
      <div class='line'>The first of subjects, viceroy of the school;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, though a prince within that realm he reigns,      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Hard is the part his duteous soul sustains.</div>
      <div class='line'>He, with his Father, o’er the furrow’d land,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Draws the long chain in his uneasy hand,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And neatly forms at home, what there they rudely plann’d;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Content, for all his labour if he gains</div>
      <div class='line'>Some words of praise, and sixpence for his pains.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus many a hungry day the Boy has fared,</div>
      <div class='line'>And would have ask’d a dinner, had he dared.</div>
      <div class='line'>When boys are playing, he for hours of school</div>
      <div class='line'>Has sums to set, and copy-books to rule;      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When all are met, for some sad dunce afraid,</div>
      <div class='line'>He, by allowance, lends his timely aid—</div>
      <div class='line'>Taught at the student’s failings to connive,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet keep his Father’s dignity alive;</div>
      <div class='line'>For ev’n Nathaniel fears, and might offend,</div>
      <div class='line'>If too severe, the farmer, now his friend;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or her, that farmer’s lady, who well knows</div>
      <div class='line'>Her boy is bright, and needs nor threats nor blows.</div>
      <div class='line'>This seem’d to Peter hard; and he was loth,</div>
      <div class='line'>T’ obey and rule, and have the cares of both—      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To miss the master’s dignity, and yet,</div>
      <div class='line'>No portion of the school-boy’s play to get.</div>
      <div class='line'>To him the Fiend, as once to Launcelot, cried,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Run from thy wrongs!”—“Run where?” his fear replied.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Run!”—said the Tempter; “if but hard thy fare,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Hard is it now—it <i>may</i> be mended there.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But still, though tempted, he refused to part,</div>
      <div class='line'>And felt the Mother clinging at his heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor this alone—he, in that weight of care,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had help, and bore it as a man should bear.      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A drop of comfort in his cup was thrown;</div>
      <div class='line'>It was his treasure, and it was his own.</div>
      <div class='line'>His Father’s shelves contained a motley store</div>
      <div class='line'>Of letter’d wealth; and this he might explore.</div>
      <div class='line'>A part his mother in her youth had gain’d,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A part Nathaniel from his club obtain’d,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And part—a well-worn kind—from sire to son remain’d.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>He sought his Mother’s hoard, and there he found</div>
      <div class='line'>Romance in sheets, and poetry unbound;</div>
      <div class='line'>Soft Tales of Love, which never damsel read,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But tears of pity stain’d her virgin bed.</div>
      <div class='line'>There were Jane Shore and Rosamond the Fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And humbler heroines frail as these were there;</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a tale of one forsaken Maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who till her death the work of vengeance stay’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her Lover, then at sea, while round him stood</div>
      <div class='line'>A dauntless crew, the angry ghost pursued;</div>
      <div class='line'>In a small boat, without an oar or sail,</div>
      <div class='line'>She came to call him, nor would force avail,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor prayer; but, conscience-stricken, down he leapt,      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er his corse the closing billows slept;</div>
      <div class='line'>All vanish’d then! but of the crew were some</div>
      <div class='line'>Wondering whose ghost would on the morrow come.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A learned Book was there, and in it schemes</div>
      <div class='line'>How to cast Fortunes and interpret Dreams;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ballads were there of Lover’s bliss or bale,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Kitchen Story, and the Nursery Tale.</div>
      <div class='line'>His hungry mind disdain’d not humble food,</div>
      <div class='line'>And read with relish keen of Robin Hood;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of him, all-powerful made by magic gift      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And Giants slain—of mighty Hickerthrift;</div>
      <div class='line'>Through Crusoe’s Isle delighted had he stray’d;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nocturnal visits had to witches paid,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Gliding through haunted scenes, enraptured and afraid.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>A loftier shelf with real books was graced,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Bound, or part bound, and ranged in comely taste:</div>
      <div class='line'>Books of high mark, the mind’s more solid food,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which some might think the owner understood;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Fluxions, Sections, Algebraic lore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our Peter left for others to explore,      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, quickly turning to a favourite kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Found what rejoiced him at his heart to find.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sir Walter wrote not then, or He by whom</div>
      <div class='line'>Such gain and glory to Sir Walter come—</div>
      <div class='line'>That Fairy-Helper, by whose secret aid</div>
      <div class='line'>Such views of life are to the world convey’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>As inspiration known in after-times,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sole assistant in his prose or rhymes.</div>
      <div class='line'>But there were fictions wild that please the boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which men, too, read, condemn, reject, enjoy—      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Arabian Nights, and Persian Tales were there,</div>
      <div class='line'>One volume each, and both the worse for wear;</div>
      <div class='line'>There by Quarles’ Emblems Esop’s Fables stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>The coats in tatters, and the cuts in wood.</div>
      <div class='line'>There, too, “The English History,” by the pen</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Doctor Cooke, and other learned men,</div>
      <div class='line'>In numbers, sixpence each; by these was seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And highly prized, the Monthly Magazine—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not such as now will men of taste engage,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the cold gleanings of a former age,      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Scraps cut from sermons, scenes removed from plays,</div>
      <div class='line'>With heads of heroes famed in Tyburn’s palmy days.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The rest we pass—though Peter pass’d them not,</div>
      <div class='line'>But here his cares and labours all forgot.</div>
      <div class='line'>Stain’d, torn, and blotted every noble page,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood the chief poets of a former age—</div>
      <div class='line'>And of the present; not their works complete,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But in such portions as on bulks we meet,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The refuse of the shops, thrown down upon the street.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There Shakspeare, Spenser, Milton found a place,      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With some a nameless, some a shameless, race,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which many a weary walker resting reads,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, pondering o’er the short relief, proceeds,</div>
      <div class='line'>While others, lingering, pay the written sum,</div>
      <div class='line'>Half loth, but longing for delight to come.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Of the Youth’s morals we would something speak,</div>
      <div class='line'>Taught by his Mother what to shun or seek.</div>
      <div class='line'>She show’d the heavenly way, and in his youth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Press’d on his yielding mind the Gospel truth,</div>
      <div class='line'>How weak is man, how much to ill inclined,      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And where his help is placed, and how to find.</div>
      <div class='line'>These words of weight sank deeply in his breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>And awful Fear and holy Hope imprest.</div>
      <div class='line'>He shrank from vice, and at the startling view,</div>
      <div class='line'>As from an adder in his path, withdrew.</div>
      <div class='line'>All else was cheerful. Peter’s easy mind</div>
      <div class='line'>To the gay scenes of village-life inclined.</div>
      <div class='line'>The lark that soaring sings his notes of joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was not more lively than th’ awaken’d boy.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet oft with this a softening sadness dwelt,      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>While, feeling thus, he marvell’d why he felt.</div>
      <div class='line'>“I am not sorry,” said the Boy, “but still,</div>
      <div class='line'>The tear will drop—I wonder why it will!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His books, his walks, his musing, morn and eve,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave such impressions as such minds receive;</div>
      <div class='line'>And with his moral and religious views</div>
      <div class='line'>Wove the wild fancies of an Infant-Muse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Inspiring thoughts that he could not express,</div>
      <div class='line'>[Obscure-sublime]! his secret happiness.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft would he strive for words, and oft begin      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To frame in verse the views he had within;</div>
      <div class='line'>But ever fail’d: for how can words explain</div>
      <div class='line'>The unform’d ideas of a teeming brain?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such was my Hero, whom I would portray</div>
      <div class='line'>In one exploit—the Hero of a Day.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At six miles’ distance from his native town</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood Silford Hall, a seat of much renown—</div>
      <div class='line'>Computed miles such weary travellers ride,</div>
      <div class='line'>When they in chance wayfaring men confide.</div>
      <div class='line'>Beauty and grandeur were within; around,      <span class='linenum'>180}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Lawn, wood, and water; the delicious ground      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Had parks where deer disport, had fields where game abound.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Fruits of all tastes in spacious gardens grew;</div>
      <div class='line'>And flowers of every scent and every hue,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>That native in more favour’d climes arise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are here protected from th’ inclement skies.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To this fair place, with mingled pride and shame</div>
      <div class='line'>This lad of learning without knowledge came—</div>
      <div class='line'>Shame for his conscious ignorance, and pride</div>
      <div class='line'>To this fair seat in this gay style to ride.      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The cause that brought him was a small account,</div>
      <div class='line'>His father’s due, and he must take the amount,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sign a stamp’d receipt! this done, he might</div>
      <div class='line'>Look all around him, and enjoy the sight.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So far to walk was, in his mother’s view,</div>
      <div class='line'>More than her darling Peter ought to do;</div>
      <div class='line'>Peter indeed knew more, but he would hide</div>
      <div class='line'>His better knowledge, for he wish’d to ride;</div>
      <div class='line'>So had his father’s nag, a beast so small,</div>
      <div class='line'>That if he fell, he had not far to fall.      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>His fond and anxious mother in his best</div>
      <div class='line'>Her darling child for the occasion drest;</div>
      <div class='line'>All in his coat of green she clothed her boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>And stood admiring with a mother’s joy;</div>
      <div class='line'>Large was it made and long, as meant to do      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For Sunday-service, when he older grew—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Not brought in daily use in one year’s wear or two.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>White was his waistcoat, and what else he wore</div>
      <div class='line'>Had clothed the lamb or parent ewe before;</div>
      <div class='line'>In all the mother show’d her care or skill;      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A riband black she tied beneath his frill;</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave him his stockings, white as driven snow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bad him heed the miry way below;</div>
      <div class='line'>On the black varnish of the comely shoe</div>
      <div class='line'>Shone the large buckle of a silvery hue;</div>
      <div class='line'>Boots he had worn, had he such things possest—</div>
      <div class='line'>But bootless grief!—he was full proudly drest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Full proudly look’d, and light he was of heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>When thus for Silford Hall prepared to start.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nathaniel’s self with joy the stripling eyed,      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And gave a shilling with a father’s pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rules of politeness too with pomp he gave,</div>
      <div class='line'>And show’d the lad how scholars should behave.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ere yet he left her home, the Mother told—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>For she had seen—what things he should behold.</div>
      <div class='line'>There, she related, her young eyes had view’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Stone figures shaped like naked flesh and blood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, in the hall and up the gallery placed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were proofs, they told her, of a noble taste;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor she denied—but, in a public hall,      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her judgment taken, she had clothed them all.</div>
      <div class='line'>There, too, were station’d, each upon its seat,</div>
      <div class='line'>Half forms of men, without their hands and feet;</div>
      <div class='line'>These and what more within that hall might be</div>
      <div class='line'>She saw, and oh! how long’d her son to see!</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet could he hope to view that noble place,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who dared not look the porter in the face?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Forth went the pony, and the rider’s knees</div>
      <div class='line'>Cleaved to her sides—he did not ride with ease;</div>
      <div class='line'>One hand a whip, and one a bridle, held,      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In case the pony falter’d or rebell’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The village boys beheld him as he pass’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And looks of envy on the hero cast;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he was meek, nor let his pride appear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, truth to speak, he felt a sense of fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lest the rude beast, unmindful of the rein,</div>
      <div class='line'>Should take a fancy to turn back again.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He found, and wonder ’tis he found, his way,</div>
      <div class='line'>The orders many that he must obey:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Now to the right, then left, and now again      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Directly onward, through the winding lane;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, half way o’er the common, by the mill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Turn from the cottage and ascend the hill;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then—spare the pony, boy!—as you ascend,</div>
      <div class='line'>You see the Hall, and that’s your journey’s end.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yes, he succeeded, not remembering aught</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this advice, but by his pony taught.</div>
      <div class='line'>Soon as he doubted he the bridle threw</div>
      <div class='line'>On the steed’s neck, and said—“Remember you!”</div>
      <div class='line'>For oft the creature had his father borne,      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Sound on his way, and safe on his return.</div>
      <div class='line'>So he succeeded, and the modest youth</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave praise, where praise had been assign’d by truth.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His business done—for fortune led his way</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>To him whose office was such debts to pay,</div>
      <div class='line'>The farmer-bailiff; but he saw no more      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Than a small room, with bare and oaken floor,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A desk with books thereon—he’d seen such things before;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Good day!” he said, but linger’d as he spoke</div>
      <div class='line'>“Good day,” and gazed about with serious look;      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then slowly moved, and then delay’d awhile,</div>
      <div class='line'>In dumb dismay which raised a lordly smile</div>
      <div class='line'>In those who eyed him—then again moved on,</div>
      <div class='line'>As all might see, unwilling to be gone.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>While puzzled thus, and puzzling all about,</div>
      <div class='line'>Involved, absorb’d, in some bewildering doubt,</div>
      <div class='line'>A lady enter’d, Madam Johnson call’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Within whose presence stood the lad appall’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>A learned Lady this, who knew the names</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the pictures in the golden frames;      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Could every subject, every painter, tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>And on their merits and their failures dwell;</div>
      <div class='line'>And if perchance there was a slight mistake—</div>
      <div class='line'>These the most knowing on such matters make.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And what dost mean, my pretty lad?” she cried,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Dost stay or go?”—He first for courage tried,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then for fit words—then boldly he replied,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That he “would give a hundred pounds, if so</div>
      <div class='line'>He had them, all about that house to go;</div>
      <div class='line'>For he had heard that it contain’d such things      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As never house could boast, except the king’s.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The ruling Lady, smiling, said, “In truth</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou shalt behold them all, my pretty youth.</div>
      <div class='line'>Tom! first the creature to the stable lead,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let it be fed; and you, my child, must feed;</div>
      <div class='line'>For three good hours must pass e’er dinner come”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Supper,” thought he, “she means, our time at home.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>First was he feasted to his heart’s content;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, all in rapture, with the Lady went;</div>
      <div class='line'>Through rooms immense, and galleries wide and tall,      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He walk’d entranced—he breathed in Silford Hall.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now could he look on that delightful place,</div>
      <div class='line'>The glorious dwelling of a princely race;</div>
      <div class='line'>His vast delight was mixed with equal awe,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>There was such magic in the things he saw;</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft standing still, with open mouth and eyes      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Turn’d here and there, alarm’d as one who tries      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>T’ escape from something strange that would before him rise.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The wall would part, and beings without name</div>
      <div class='line'>Would come—for such to his adventures came;      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Hence undefined and solemn terror press’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon his mind, and all his powers possess’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>All he had read of magic, every charm,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were he alone, might come and do him harm;</div>
      <div class='line'>But his gaze rested on his friendly guide—</div>
      <div class='line'>“I’m safe,” he thought, “so long as you abide.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In one large room was found a bed of state—</div>
      <div class='line'>“And can they soundly sleep beneath such weight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where they may figures in the night explore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Form’d by the dim light dancing on the floor      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>From the far window; mirrors broad and high</div>
      <div class='line'>Doubling each terror to the anxious eye?—</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis strange,” thought Peter, “that such things produce</div>
      <div class='line'>No fear in <i>her</i>; but there is much in use.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>On that reflecting brightness, passing by,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Boy one instant fix’d his restless eye—</div>
      <div class='line'>And saw himself: he had before descried</div>
      <div class='line'>His face in one his mother’s store supplied;</div>
      <div class='line'>But here he could his whole dimensions view,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the pale forehead to the jet-black shoe.      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Passing, he look’d and, looking, grieved to pass</div>
      <div class='line'>From the fair figure smiling in the glass.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas so Narcissus saw the boy advance</div>
      <div class='line'>In the dear fount, and met th’ admiring glance</div>
      <div class='line'>So loved—But no! our happier boy admired,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not the slim form, but what the form attired—</div>
      <div class='line'>The riband, shirt, and frill, all pure and clean,</div>
      <div class='line'>The white ribb’d stockings, and the coat of green.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Lady now appear’d to move away—</div>
      <div class='line'>And this was threat’ning; for he dared not stay,      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Lost and alone; but earnestly he pray’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Oh! do not leave me—I am not afraid,</div>
      <div class='line'>But ’tis so lonesome; I shall never find</div>
      <div class='line'>My way alone, no better than the blind.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The Matron kindly to the Boy replied,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Trust in my promise, I will be thy guide.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then to the Chapel moved the friendly pair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And well for Peter that his guide was there!</div>
      <div class='line'>Dim, silent, solemn was the scene—he felt</div>
      <div class='line'>The cedar’s power, that so unearthly smelt;      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And then the stain’d, dark, narrow windows threw</div>
      <div class='line'>Strange, partial beams on pulpit, desk, and pew:</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the altar, glorious to behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood a vast pair of candlesticks in gold!</div>
      <div class='line'>With candles tall, and large, and firm, and white.</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as the halls of giant-kings would light.</div>
      <div class='line'>There was an organ, too, but now unseen;</div>
      <div class='line'>A long black curtain served it for a screen;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not so the clock that, both by night and day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Click’d the short moments as they pass’d away.      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Is this a church? and does the parson read”—</div>
      <div class='line'>Said Peter—“here?—I mean, a church indeed?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Indeed it is, or as a church is used,”</div>
      <div class='line'>Was the reply—and Peter deeply mused,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not without awe. His sadness to dispel,</div>
      <div class='line'>They sought the gallery; and then all was well.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet, enter’d there, although so clear his mind</div>
      <div class='line'>From every fear substantial and defined,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet there remain’d some touch of native fear—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of something awful to the eye and ear—      <span class='linenum'>370}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A ghostly voice might sound—a ghost itself appear.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>There noble Pictures fill’d his mind with joy—</div>
      <div class='line'>He gazed and thought, and was no more the boy;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Madam heard him speak, with some surprise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of heroes known to him from histories;</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew the actors in the deeds of old—</div>
      <div class='line'>He could the Roman marvels all unfold.</div>
      <div class='line'>He to his guide a theme for wonder grew,</div>
      <div class='line'>At once so little and so much he knew—</div>
      <div class='line'>Little of what was passing every day,      <span class='linenum'>380&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And much of that which long had pass’d away;—</div>
      <div class='line'>So like a man, and yet so like a child,</div>
      <div class='line'>That his good friend stood wond’ring as she smiled.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Scripture Pieces caused a serious awe,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>And he with reverence look’d on all he saw;</div>
      <div class='line'>His pious wonder he express’d aloud,</div>
      <div class='line'>And at the Saviour Form devoutly bow’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Portraits he pass’d, admiring; but with pain</div>
      <div class='line'>Turn’d from some objects, nor would look again.</div>
      <div class='line'>He seem’d to think that something wrong was done,      <span class='linenum'>390&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When crimes were shown he blush’d to look upon.</div>
      <div class='line'>Not so his guide—“What youth is that?” she cried,</div>
      <div class='line'>“That handsome stripling at the lady’s side;</div>
      <div class='line'>Can you inform me how the youth is named?”</div>
      <div class='line'>He answer’d, “Joseph”; but he look’d ashamed.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Well, and what then? Had you been Joseph, boy!</div>
      <div class='line'>Would you have been so peevish and so coy?”</div>
      <div class='line'>Our hero answer’d, with a glowing face,</div>
      <div class='line'>“His mother told him he should pray for grace.”</div>
      <div class='line'>A transient cloud o’ercast the matron’s brow;      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She seem’d disposed to laugh——but knew not how;</div>
      <div class='line'>Silent awhile, then placid she appear’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis but a child,” she thought, and all was clear’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>No—laugh she could not; still, the more she sought</div>
      <div class='line'>To hide her thoughts, the more of his she caught.</div>
      <div class='line'>A hundred times she had these pictures named,</div>
      <div class='line'>And never felt perplex’d, disturb’d, ashamed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet now the feelings of a lad so young</div>
      <div class='line'>Call’d home her thoughts and paralysed her tongue.</div>
      <div class='line'>She pass’d the offensive pictures silent by,      <span class='linenum'>410&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With one reflecting, self-reproving sigh;</div>
      <div class='line'>Reasoning, how habit will the mind entice</div>
      <div class='line'>To approach and gaze upon the bounds of vice,</div>
      <div class='line'>As men, by custom, from some cliff’s vast height,</div>
      <div class='line'>Look pleased, and make their danger their delight.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Come, let us on!—see there a Flemish view,</div>
      <div class='line'>A Country Fair, and all as Nature true.</div>
      <div class='line'>See there the merry creatures, great and small,</div>
      <div class='line'>Engaged in drinking, gaming, dancing all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fiddling or fighting—all in drunken joy!”—      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“But is this Nature?” said the wondering Boy.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Be sure it is! and those Banditti there—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Observe the faces, forms, the eyes, the air;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>See rage, revenge, remorse, disdain, despair!”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“And is that Nature, too?” the stripling cried.—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Corrupted Nature,” said the serious guide.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She then displayed her knowledge.—“That, my dear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is call’d a Titian, this a Guido here,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yon a Claude—you see that lovely light,</div>
      <div class='line'>So soft and solemn, neither day nor night.”      <span class='linenum'>430&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Yes!” quoth the Boy, “and there is just the breeze,</div>
      <div class='line'>That curls the water, and that fans the trees;</div>
      <div class='line'>The ships that anchor in that pleasant bay</div>
      <div class='line'>All look so safe and quiet—Claude, you say?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>On a small picture Peter gazed and stood</div>
      <div class='line'>In admiration—“’twas so dearly good.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“For how much money think you, then, my Lad,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is such a ‘dear good picture’ to be had?</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis a famed master’s work—a Gerard Dow,</div>
      <div class='line'>At least the seller told the buyer so.”      <span class='linenum'>440&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I tell the price!” quoth Peter—“I as soon</div>
      <div class='line'>Could tell the price of pictures in the moon;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I have heard, when the great race was done,</div>
      <div class='line'>How much was offer’d for the horse that won.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“A thousand pounds: but, look the country round,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, may be, ten such horses might be found;</div>
      <div class='line'>While, ride or run where’er you choose to go,</div>
      <div class='line'>You’ll nowhere find so fine a Gerard Dow.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“If this be true,” says Peter, “then, of course,</div>
      <div class='line'>You’d rate the picture higher than the horse.”      <span class='linenum'>450&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Why, thou’rt a reasoner, Boy!” the lady cried;</div>
      <div class='line'>“But see that Infant on the other side;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis by Sir Joshua. Did you ever see</div>
      <div class='line'>A Babe so charming?”—“No, indeed,” said he;</div>
      <div class='line'>“I wonder how he could that look invent,</div>
      <div class='line'>That seems so sly, and yet so innocent.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In this long room were various Statues seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Peter gazed thereon with awe-struck mien.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Why look so earnest, Boy?”—“Because they bring</div>
      <div class='line'>To me a story of an awful thing.”—      <span class='linenum'>460&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Tell then thy story.”——He, who never stay’d</div>
      <div class='line'>For words or matter, instantly obey’d.—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“A holy pilgrim to a city sail’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where every sin o’er sinful men prevail’d;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Who, when he landed, look’d in every street,</div>
      <div class='line'>As he was wont, a busy crowd to meet;</div>
      <div class='line'>But now of living beings found he none;</div>
      <div class='line'>Death had been there, and turn’d them all to stone.</div>
      <div class='line'>All in an instant, as they were employ’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was life in every living man destroy’d—      <span class='linenum'>470&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The rich, the poor, the timid, and the bold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Made in a moment such as we behold.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Come, my good lad, you’ve yet a room to see.</div>
      <div class='line'>Are you awake?”—“I am amazed,” said he;</div>
      <div class='line'>I know they’re figures form’d by human skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>But ’tis so awful, and this place so still!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And what is this?” said Peter, who had seen</div>
      <div class='line'>A long wide table, with its cloth of green,</div>
      <div class='line'>Its net-work pockets, and its studs of gold—</div>
      <div class='line'>For such they seem’d, and precious to behold.      <span class='linenum'>480&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There too were ivory balls, and one was red,</div>
      <div class='line'>Laid with long sticks upon the soft green bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And printed tables on the wall beside—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Oh! what are these?” the wondering Peter cried.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“This, my good lad, is call’d the Billiard-room,”</div>
      <div class='line'>Answer’d his guide; “and here the gentry come,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with these maces and these cues they play,</div>
      <div class='line'>At their spare time, or in a rainy day.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And what this chequer’d box?—for play, I guess?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“You judge it right; ’tis for the game of Chess.      <span class='linenum'>490&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There! take your time, examine what you will,</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s King, Queen, Knight—it is a game of skill:</div>
      <div class='line'>And these are Bishops; you the difference see.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“What! do they make a game of <i>them</i>?” quoth he.—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Bishops, like Kings,” she said, “are here but names;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not that I answer for their Honours’ games.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>All round the house did Peter go, and found</div>
      <div class='line'>Food for his wonder all the house around.</div>
      <div class='line'>There guns of various bore, and rods, and lines,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all that man for deed of death designs,      <span class='linenum'>500&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In beast, or bird, or fish, or worm, or fly—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Life in these last must means of death supply;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The living bait is gorged, and both the victims die.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“God gives man leave his creatures to destroy.”—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“What! for his sport?” replied the pitying Boy.—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Nay,” said the Lady, “why the sport condemn?</div>
      <div class='line'>As die they must, ’tis much the same to them.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Peter had doubts; but with so kind a friend</div>
      <div class='line'>He would not on a dubious point contend.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Much had he seen, and every thing he saw      <span class='linenum'>510&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Excited pleasure not unmix’d with awe.</div>
      <div class='line'>Leaving each room, he turn’d as if once more</div>
      <div class='line'>To enjoy the pleasure that he felt before—</div>
      <div class='line'>“What then must their possessors feel? how grand</div>
      <div class='line'>And happy they who can such joys command!</div>
      <div class='line'>For they may pleasures all their lives pursue,</div>
      <div class='line'>The winter pleasures, and the summer’s too—</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleasures for every hour in every day—</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! how their time must pass in joy away!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So Peter said.—Replied the courteous Dame:      <span class='linenum'>520&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“What you call pleasure scarcely owns the name.</div>
      <div class='line'>The very changes of amusement prove</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s nothing that deserves a lasting love.</div>
      <div class='line'>They hunt, they course, they shoot, they fish, they game;</div>
      <div class='line'>The objects vary, though the end the same—</div>
      <div class='line'>A search for that which flies them; no, my Boy!</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis not enjoyment, ’tis pursuit of joy.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Peter was thoughtful—thinking, What! not these,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who can command, or purchase, what they please—</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom many serve, who only speak the word,      <span class='linenum'>530&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And they have all that earth or seas afford—</div>
      <div class='line'>All that can charm the mind and please the eye—</div>
      <div class='line'>And <i>they</i> not happy!—but I’ll ask her why.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So Peter ask’d.—“’Tis not,” she said, “for us,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their Honours’ inward feelings to discuss;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, if they’re happy, they would still confess</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis not these things that make their happiness.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Look from this window! at his work behold</div>
      <div class='line'>Yon gardener’s helper—he is poor and old,</div>
      <div class='line'>He not one thing of all you see can call      <span class='linenum'>540&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His own; but, haply, he o’erlooks them all.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hear him! he whistles through his work, or stops</div>
      <div class='line'>But to admire his labours and his crops.</div>
      <div class='line'>To-day as every former day he fares,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>And for the morrow has nor doubts nor cares;</div>
      <div class='line'>Pious and cheerful, proud when he can please—</div>
      <div class='line'>Judge if Joe Tompkin wants such things as these.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Come, let us forward!” and she walk’d in haste</div>
      <div class='line'>To a large room, itself a work of taste,</div>
      <div class='line'>But chiefly valued for the works that drew      <span class='linenum'>550&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The eyes of Peter—this indeed was new,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was most imposing—Books of every kind</div>
      <div class='line'>Were there disposed, the food for every mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>With joy perplex’d, round cast he wondering eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still in his joy, and dumb in his surprise.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Above, beneath, around, on every side,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of every form and size were Books descried;</div>
      <div class='line'>Like Bishop Hatto, when the rats drew near,</div>
      <div class='line'>And war’s new dangers waked his guilty fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>When thousands came beside, behind, before,      <span class='linenum'>560&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And up and down came on ten thousand more,</div>
      <div class='line'>A tail’d and whisker’d army, each with claws</div>
      <div class='line'>As sharp as needles, and with teeth like saws—</div>
      <div class='line'>So fill’d with awe, and wonder in his looks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood Peter ‘midst this multitude of Books;</div>
      <div class='line'>But guiltless he and fearless; yet he sigh’d</div>
      <div class='line'>To think what treasures were to him denied.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But wonder ceases on continued view;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the Boy sharp for close inspection grew.</div>
      <div class='line'>Prints on the table he at first survey’d,      <span class='linenum'>570&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then to the Books his full attention paid.</div>
      <div class='line'>At first, from tome to tome, as fancy led,</div>
      <div class='line'>He view’d the binding, and the titles read;</div>
      <div class='line'>Lost in delight, and with his freedom pleased,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then three huge folios from their shelf he seized;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fixing on one, with prints of every race,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of beast and bird most rare in every place—</div>
      <div class='line'>Serpents, the giants of their tribe, whose prey</div>
      <div class='line'>Are giants too—a wild ox once a day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here the fierce tiger, and the desert’s kings,      <span class='linenum'>580&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And all that move on feet, or fins, or wings—</div>
      <div class='line'>Most rare and strange; a second volume told</div>
      <div class='line'>Of battles dire, and dreadful to behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>On sea or land, and fleets dispersed in storms;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>A third has all creative fancy forms—</div>
      <div class='line'>Hydra and dire chimera, deserts rude,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ruins grand, enriching solitude:</div>
      <div class='line'>Whatever was, or was supposed to be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Saw Peter here, and still desired to see.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Again he look’d, but happier had he been,      <span class='linenum'>590&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That Book of Wonders he had never seen;</div>
      <div class='line'>For there were tales of men of wicked mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And how the Foe of Man deludes mankind.</div>
      <div class='line'>Magic and murder every leaf bespread—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Enchanted halls, and chambers of the dead,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And ghosts that haunt the scenes where once the victims bled.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Just at this time, when Peter’s heart began</div>
      <div class='line'>To admit the fear that shames the valiant man,</div>
      <div class='line'>He paused—but why? “Here’s one my guard to be;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When thus protected, none can trouble me.”—      <span class='linenum'>600}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then rising look’d he round, and lo! alone was he.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Three ponderous doors, with locks of shining brass,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seem’d to invite the trembling Boy to pass;</div>
      <div class='line'>But fear forbad, till fear itself supplied</div>
      <div class='line'>The place of courage, and at length he tried.</div>
      <div class='line'>He grasp’d the key—Alas! though great his need,</div>
      <div class='line'>The key turn’d not, the bolt would not recede.</div>
      <div class='line'>Try then again; for what will not distress?</div>
      <div class='line'>Again he tried, and with the same success.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet one remains, remains untried one door—      <span class='linenum'>610&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A failing hope, for two had fail’d before;</div>
      <div class='line'>But a bold prince, with fifty doors in sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tried forty-nine before he found the right;</div>
      <div class='line'>Before he mounted on the brazen horse,</div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er the walls pursued his airy course.</div>
      <div class='line'>So his cold hand on this last key he laid:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Now turn,” said he; the treacherous bolt obey’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>The door receded—bringing full in view</div>
      <div class='line'>The dim, dull chapel, pulpit, desk, and pew.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It was not right—it would have vex’d a saint;      <span class='linenum'>620&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And Peter’s anger rose above restraint.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Was this her love,” he cried, “to bring me here,</div>
      <div class='line'>Among the dead, to die myself with fear!”—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>For Peter judged, with monuments around,</div>
      <div class='line'>The dead must surely in the place be found:—</div>
      <div class='line'>“With cold to shiver, and with hunger pine!</div>
      <div class='line'>‘We’ll see the rooms,’ she said, ‘before we dine;’</div>
      <div class='line'>And spake so kind! That window gives no light:      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Here is enough the boldest man to fright;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It hardly now is day, and soon it will be night.”      <span class='linenum'>630}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Deeply he sigh’d, nor from his heart could chase</div>
      <div class='line'>The dread of dying in that dismal place;</div>
      <div class='line'>Anger and sorrow in his bosom strove,</div>
      <div class='line'>And banish’d all that yet remain’d of love;</div>
      <div class='line'>When soon despair had seized the trembling Boy—</div>
      <div class='line'>But hark, a voice! the sound of peace and joy.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Where art thou, lad?”—“Oh! here am I, in doubt,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sorely frighten’d—can you let me out?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Oh! yes, my child; it was indeed a sin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Forgetful as I was, to bolt you in.      <span class='linenum'>640&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I left you reading, and from habit lock’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The door behind me, but in truth am shock’d</div>
      <div class='line'>To serve you thus; but we will make amends</div>
      <div class='line'>For such mistake. Come, cheerly, we are friends.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Oh! yes,” said Peter, quite alive to be</div>
      <div class='line'>So kindly used, and have so much to see,</div>
      <div class='line'>And having so much seen; his way he spied,</div>
      <div class='line'>Forgot his peril, and rejoin’d his guide.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now all beheld, his admiration raised,</div>
      <div class='line'>The lady thank’d, her condescension praised,      <span class='linenum'>650&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And fix’d the hour for dinner, forth the Boy</div>
      <div class='line'>Went in a tumult of o’erpowering joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>To view the gardens, and what more was found</div>
      <div class='line'>In the wide circuit of that spacious ground;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till, with his thoughts bewilder’d, and oppress’d</div>
      <div class='line'>With too much feeling, he inclined to rest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then in the park he sought its deepest shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>By trees more aged than the mansion made,</div>
      <div class='line'>That ages stood; and there unseen a brook</div>
      <div class='line'>Ran not unheard, and thus our traveller spoke—      <span class='linenum'>660&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“I am so happy, and have such delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>I cannot bear to see another sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>It wearies one like work;” and so, with deep</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Unconscious sigh—he laid him down to sleep.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus he reclining slept, and, oh! the joy</div>
      <div class='line'>That in his dreams possess’d the happy Boy—</div>
      <div class='line'>Composed of all he knew, and all he read,</div>
      <div class='line'>Heard, or conceived, the living and the dead.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Caliph Haroun, walking forth by night</div>
      <div class='line'>To see young David and Goliath fight,      <span class='linenum'>670&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Rose on his passive fancy—then appear’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The fleshless forms of beings scorn’d or fear’d</div>
      <div class='line'>By just or evil men—the baneful race</div>
      <div class='line'>Of spirits restless, borne from place to place;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rivers of blood from conquer’d armies ran;</div>
      <div class='line'>The flying steed was by, the marble man;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then danced the fairies round their pygmy queen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And their feet twinkled on the dewy green,</div>
      <div class='line'>All in the moon-beams’ glory. As they fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>The mountain loadstone rear’d its fatal head,      <span class='linenum'>680&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And drew the iron-bolted ships on shore,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Where he distinctly heard the billows roar,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Mix’d with a living voice of—“Youngster, sleep no more,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But haste to dinner.” Starting from the ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>The waking boy obey’d that welcome sound.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He went and sat, with equal shame and pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>A welcome guest at Madam Johnson’s side;</div>
      <div class='line'>At his right hand was Mistress Kitty placed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Lucy, maiden sly, the stripling faced.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then each the proper seat at table took—      <span class='linenum'>690&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Groom, butler, footman, laundress, coachman, cook;</div>
      <div class='line'>For all their station and their office knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor sat as rustics or the rabble do.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Youth to each the due attention paid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hob-or-nob’d with Lady Charlotte’s maid;</div>
      <div class='line'>With much respect each other they address’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all encouraged their enchanted guest.</div>
      <div class='line'>Wine, fruit, and sweetmeats closed repast so long,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Mistress Flora sang an opera song.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such was the Day the happy Boy had spent,      <span class='linenum'>700&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And forth delighted from the Hall he went.</div>
      <div class='line'>Bowing his thanks, he mounted on his steed,</div>
      <div class='line'>More largely fed than he was wont to feed;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>And well for Peter that his pony knew</div>
      <div class='line'>From whence he came, the road he should pursue;</div>
      <div class='line'>For the young rider had his mind estranged</div>
      <div class='line'>From all around, disturb’d and disarranged,</div>
      <div class='line'>In pleasing tumult, in a dream of bliss,</div>
      <div class='line'>Enjoy’d but seldom in a world like this.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But though the pleasures of the Day were past—      <span class='linenum'>710&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For lively pleasures are not form’d to last—</div>
      <div class='line'>And though less vivid they became, less strong,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through life they lived, and were enjoy’d as long.</div>
      <div class='line'>So deep the impression of that happy Day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not time nor cares could wear it all away;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ev’n to the last, in his declining years,</div>
      <div class='line'>He told of all his glories, all his fears:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How blithely forward in that morn he went,</div>
      <div class='line'>How blest the hours in that fair palace spent,</div>
      <div class='line'>How vast that Mansion, sure for monarch plann’d,      <span class='linenum'>720&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The rooms so many, and yet each so grand—</div>
      <div class='line'>Millions of books in one large hall were found,</div>
      <div class='line'>And glorious pictures every room around;</div>
      <div class='line'>Beside that strangest of the wonders there,</div>
      <div class='line'>That house itself contain’d a house of prayer.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He told of park and wood, of sun and shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>And how the lake below the lawn was made;</div>
      <div class='line'>He spake of feasting such as never boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Taught in his school, was fated to enjoy—</div>
      <div class='line'>Of ladies’ maids as ladies’ selves who dress’d,      <span class='linenum'>730}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And her, his friend, distinguish’d from the rest,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>By grandeur in her look, and state that she possess’d.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He pass’d not one; his grateful mind o’erflow’d</div>
      <div class='line'>With sense of all he felt, and they bestow’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He spake of every office, great or small,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Within, without, and spake with praise of all—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So pass’d the happy Boy that Day at Silford Hall.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>I</span>n a large town, a wealthy, thriving place,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where hopes of gain excite an anxious race;</div>
      <div class='line'>Which dark, dense wreaths of cloudy volumes cloak,</div>
      <div class='line'>And mark, for leagues around, the place of smoke;</div>
      <div class='line'>Where fire to water lends its powerful aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And steam produces—strong ally to trade—</div>
      <div class='line'>Arrived a Stranger, whom no merchant knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor could conjecture what he came to do.</div>
      <div class='line'>He came not there his fortune to amend;</div>
      <div class='line'>He came not there a fortune made to spend;      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His age not that which men in trade employ;</div>
      <div class='line'>The place not that where men their wealth enjoy;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet there was something in his air that told</div>
      <div class='line'>Of competency gain’d, before the man was old.</div>
      <div class='line'>He brought no servants with him; those he sought</div>
      <div class='line'>Were soon his habits and his manners taught—</div>
      <div class='line'>His manners easy, civil, kind, and free;</div>
      <div class='line'>His habits such as aged men’s will be,</div>
      <div class='line'>To self indulgent; wealthy men like him</div>
      <div class='line'>Plead for these failings—’tis their way, their whim.      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>His frank good-humour, his untroubled air,</div>
      <div class='line'>His free address, and language bold but fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Soon made him friends—such friends as all may make,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who take the way that he was pleased to take.</div>
      <div class='line'>He gave his dinners in a handsome style,</div>
      <div class='line'>And met his neighbours with a social smile;</div>
      <div class='line'>The wealthy all their easy friend approved,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Whom the more liberal for his bounty loved;</div>
      <div class='line'>And ev’n the cautious and reserved began</div>
      <div class='line'>To speak with kindness of the frank old man,      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who, though associate with the rich and grave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Laugh’d with the gay, and to the needy gave</div>
      <div class='line'>What need requires. At church a seat was shown,</div>
      <div class='line'>That he was kindly ask’d to think his own.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thither he went, and neither cold nor heat,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pains or pretences, kept him from his seat.</div>
      <div class='line'>This to his credit in the town was told,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ladies said, “’Tis pity he is old;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, for his years, the Stranger moves like one</div>
      <div class='line'>Who, of his race, has no small part to run.”      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>No envy he by ostentation raised,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all his hospitable table praised.</div>
      <div class='line'>His quiet life censorious talk suppress’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And numbers hail’d him as their welcome guest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>’Twas thought a man so mild, and bounteous too,</div>
      <div class='line'>A world of good within the town might do;</div>
      <div class='line'>To vote him honours, therefore, they inclined;</div>
      <div class='line'>But these he sought not, and with thanks resign’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>His days of business, he declared, were past,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he would wait in quiet for the last;      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But for a dinner and a day of mirth</div>
      <div class='line'>He was the readiest being upon earth.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Men call’d him Captain, and they found the name</div>
      <div class='line'>By him accepted without pride or shame.</div>
      <div class='line'>Not in the Navy—that did not appear:</div>
      <div class='line'>Not in the Army—that at least was clear—</div>
      <div class='line'>“But as he speaks of sea-affairs, he made,</div>
      <div class='line'>No doubt, his fortune in the way of trade;</div>
      <div class='line'>He might, perhaps, an India-ship command—</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll call him Captain now he comes to land.”      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Stranger much of various life had seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Been poor, been rich, and in the state between;</div>
      <div class='line'>Had much of kindness met, and much deceit,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all that man who deals with men must meet.</div>
      <div class='line'>Not much he read; but from his youth had thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>And been by care and observation taught:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis thus a man his own opinions makes;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>He holds that fast, which he with trouble takes;</div>
      <div class='line'>While one whose notions all from books arise,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Upon his authors, not himself, relies—      <span class='linenum'>70}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A borrow’d wisdom this, that does not make us wise.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Inured to scenes, where wealth and place command</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ observant eye, and the obedient hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>A Tory-spírit his—he ever paid</div>
      <div class='line'>Obedience due, and look’d to be obey’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Man upon man depends, and, break the chain,</div>
      <div class='line'>He soon returns to savage life again;</div>
      <div class='line'>As of fair virgins dancing in a round</div>
      <div class='line'>Each binds another, and herself is bound,</div>
      <div class='line'>On either hand a social tribe he sees,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>By those assisted, and assisting these;</div>
      <div class='line'>While to the general welfare all belong,</div>
      <div class='line'>The high in power, the low in number strong.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such was the Stranger’s creed—if not profound,</div>
      <div class='line'>He judg’d it useful, and proclaimed it sound;</div>
      <div class='line'>And many liked it; invitations went</div>
      <div class='line'>To Captain Elliot, and from him were sent—</div>
      <div class='line'>These last so often, that his friends confess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Captain’s cook had not a place of rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>Still were they something at a loss to guess      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What his profession was from his address;</div>
      <div class='line'>For much he knew, and too correct was he</div>
      <div class='line'>For a man train’d and nurtured on the sea;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet well he knew the seaman’s words and ways—</div>
      <div class='line'>Seaman’s his look, and nautical his phrase:</div>
      <div class='line'>In fact, all ended, just where they began,</div>
      <div class='line'>With many a doubt of this amphibious man.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Though kind to all, he look’d with special grace      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>On a few members of an ancient race,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Long known, and well respected in the place—      <span class='linenum'>100}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Dyson their name; but how regard for these</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose in his mind, or why they seem’d to please,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or by what ways, what virtues—not a cause</div>
      <div class='line'>Can we assign, for Fancy has no laws;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, as the Captain show’d them such respect,</div>
      <div class='line'>We will not treat the Dysons with neglect.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Their Father died, while yet engaged by trade</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>To make a fortune that was never made,</div>
      <div class='line'>But to his children taught; for he would say</div>
      <div class='line'>“I place them—all I can—in Fortune’s way.”      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>James was his first-born; when his father died,</div>
      <div class='line'>He, in their large domain, the place supplied,</div>
      <div class='line'>And found, as to the Dysons all appear’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Affairs less gloomy than their sire had fear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>But then, if rich or poor, all now agree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Frugal and careful James must wealthy be:</div>
      <div class='line'>And, wealth in wedlock sought, he married soon,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ruled his Lady from the honey-moon.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor shall we wonder; for, his house beside,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He had a sturdy multitude to guide,      <span class='linenum'>120}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who now his spirit vex’d, and now his temper tried:      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Men who by labours live, and, day by day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Work, weave, and spin their active lives away;</div>
      <div class='line'>Like bees industrious, they for others strive,</div>
      <div class='line'>With, now and then, some murmuring in the hive.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James was a churchman—’twas his pride and boast;</div>
      <div class='line'>Loyal his heart, and “Church and King” his toast;</div>
      <div class='line'>He for Religion might not warmly feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>But for the Church he had abounding zeal.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet no dissenting sect would he condemn,      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“They’re nought to us,” said he, “nor we to them;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis innovation of our own I hate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whims and inventions of a modern date.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Why send you Bibles all the world about,</div>
      <div class='line'>That men may read amiss, and learn to doubt?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why teach the children of the poor to read,</div>
      <div class='line'>That a new race of doubters may succeed?</div>
      <div class='line'>Now can you scarcely rule the stubborn crew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what if they should know as much as you?</div>
      <div class='line'>Will a man labour when to learning bred,      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or use his hands who can employ his head?</div>
      <div class='line'>Will he a clerk or master’s self obey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who thinks himself as well-inform’d as they?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>These were his favourite subjects—these he chose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And where he ruled no creature durst oppose.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“[We’re] rich,” quoth James; “but if we thus proceed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And give to all, we shall be poor indeed:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>In war we subsidise the world—in peace</div>
      <div class='line'>We christianise—our bounties never cease;</div>
      <div class='line'>We learn each stranger’s tongue, that they with ease      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>May read translated Scriptures, if they please;</div>
      <div class='line'>We buy them presses, print them books, and then</div>
      <div class='line'>Pay and export poor learned, pious men;</div>
      <div class='line'>Vainly we strive a fortune now to get,</div>
      <div class='line'>So tax’d by private claims, and public debt.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Still he proceeds—“You make your prisons light,</div>
      <div class='line'>Airy and clean, your robbers to invite;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in such ways your pity show to vice,</div>
      <div class='line'>That you the rogues encourage, and entice.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For lenient measures James had no regard—      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Hardship,” he said, “must work upon the hard;</div>
      <div class='line'>Labour and chains such desperate men require;</div>
      <div class='line'>To soften iron you must use the fire.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Active himself, he labour’d to express,</div>
      <div class='line'>In his strong words, his scorn of idleness;</div>
      <div class='line'>From him in vain the beggar sought relief—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Who will not labour is an idle thief,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stealing from those who will;” he knew not how</div>
      <div class='line'>For the untaught and ill-taught to allow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Children of want and vice, inured to ill,      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Unchain’d the passions, and uncurb’d the will.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Alas! he look’d but to his own affairs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or to the rivals in his trade, and theirs;</div>
      <div class='line'>Knew not the thousands who must all be fed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet ne’er were taught to earn their daily bread;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom crimes, misfortunes, errors only teach</div>
      <div class='line'>To seek their food where’er within their reach;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who for their parents’ sins, or for their own,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are now as vagrants, wanderers, beggars known,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hunted and hunting through the world, to share      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Alms and contempt, and shame and scorn to bear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom Law condemns, and Justice, with a sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pursuing, shakes her sword and passes by.—</div>
      <div class='line'>If to the prison we should these commit,</div>
      <div class='line'>They for the gallows will be render’d fit.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But James had virtues—was esteem’d as one</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom men look’d up to, and relied upon.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Kind to his equals, social when they met—</div>
      <div class='line'>If out of spirits, always out of debt;</div>
      <div class='line'>True to his promise, he a lie disdain’d,      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And e’en when tempted in his trade, refrain’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Frugal he was, and loved the cash to spare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gain’d by much skill, and nursed by constant care;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet liked the social board, and when he spoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some hail’d his wisdom, some enjoy’d his joke.</div>
      <div class='line'>To him a Brother look’d as one to whom,</div>
      <div class='line'>If fortune frown’d, he might in trouble come;</div>
      <div class='line'>His Sisters view’d the important man with awe,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if a parent in his place they saw:</div>
      <div class='line'>All lived in Love; none sought their private ends:      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The Dysons were a Family of Friends.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His brother David was a studious boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet could his sports as well as books enjoy.</div>
      <div class='line'>E’en when a boy, he was not quickly read,</div>
      <div class='line'>If by the heart you judged him, or the head.</div>
      <div class='line'>His father thought he was decreed to shine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And be in time an eminent Divine;</div>
      <div class='line'>But if he ever to the Church inclined,</div>
      <div class='line'>It is too certain that he changed his mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>He spoke of scruples; but who knew him best      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Affirm’d, no scruples broke on David’s rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>Physic and Law were each in turn proposed,</div>
      <div class='line'>He weigh’d them nicely, and with Physic closed.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He had a serious air, a smooth address,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a firm spirit that ensured success.</div>
      <div class='line'>He watched his brethren of the time, how they</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose into fame, that he might choose his way.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Some, he observed, a kind of roughness used,</div>
      <div class='line'>And now their patients banter’d, now abused:</div>
      <div class='line'>The awe-struck people were at once dismay’d,      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As if they begg’d the advice for which they paid.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There are who hold that no disease is slight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who magnify the foe with whom they fight.</div>
      <div class='line'>The sick was told that his was that disease</div>
      <div class='line'>But rarely known on mortal frame to seize;</div>
      <div class='line'>Which only skill profound, and full command</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the powers in nature could withstand.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Then, if he lived, what fame the conquest gave!</div>
      <div class='line'>And if he died—“No human power could save!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Mere fortune sometimes, and a lucky case,      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Will make a man the idol of a place—</div>
      <div class='line'>Who last, advice to some fair duchess gave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or snatch’d a widow’s darling from the grave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Him first she honours of the lucky tribe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fills him with praise, and woos him to prescribe.</div>
      <div class='line'>In his own chariot soon he rattles on,</div>
      <div class='line'>And half believes the lies that built him one.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But not of these was David: care and pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And studious toil prepar’d his way to gain.</div>
      <div class='line'>At first observed, then trusted, he became      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At length respected, and acquired a name.</div>
      <div class='line'>Keen, close, attentive, he could read mankind,</div>
      <div class='line'>The feeble body, and the failing mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>And if his heart remain’d untouch’d, his eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>His air, and tone, with all could sympathise.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This brought him fees, and not a man was he</div>
      <div class='line'>In weak compassion to refuse a fee.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet though the Doctor’s purse was well supplied,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though patients came, and fees were multiplied,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some secret drain, that none presumed to know,      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And few e’en guess’d, for ever kept it low.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some of a patient spake, a tender fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of whom the doctor took peculiar care,</div>
      <div class='line'>But not a fee; he, rather, largely gave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor spared himself, ’twas said, this gentle friend to save.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her case consumptive, with perpetual need</div>
      <div class='line'>Still to be fed, and still desire to feed;</div>
      <div class='line'>An eager craving, seldom known to cease,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gold alone brought temporary peace.—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So, rich he was not; James some fear express’d,      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Dear Doctor David would be yet distress’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>For if now poor, when so repaid his skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>What fate were his, if he himself were ill!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In his religion, Doctor Dyson sought</div>
      <div class='line'>To teach himself—“A man should not be taught,</div>
      <div class='line'>Should not, by forms or creeds, his mind debase,</div>
      <div class='line'>That keep in awe an unreflecting race.”</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>He heeded not what Clarke and Paley say,</div>
      <div class='line'>But thought himself as good a judge as they;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet to the Church profess’d himself a friend,      <span class='linenum'>270}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And would the rector for his hour attend;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, praise the learn’d discourse, and learnedly defend.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For, since the common herd of men are blind,</div>
      <div class='line'>He judged it right that guides should be assign’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>And that the few who could themselves direct</div>
      <div class='line'>Should treat those guides with honour and respect.</div>
      <div class='line'>He was from all contracted notions freed,</div>
      <div class='line'>But gave his Brother credit for his creed;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if in smaller matters he indulged,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas well, so long as they were not divulged.      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oft was the spirit of the Doctor tried,</div>
      <div class='line'>When his grave Sister wish’d to be his guide.</div>
      <div class='line'>She told him, “all his real friends were grieved</div>
      <div class='line'>To hear it said, how little he believed:</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all who bore the name she never knew</div>
      <div class='line'>One to his pastor or his church untrue;</div>
      <div class='line'>All have the truth with mutual zeal profess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And why, dear Doctor, differ from the rest?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“’Tis my hard fate,” with serious looks replied</div>
      <div class='line'>The man of doubt, “to err with such a guide.”—      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Then why not turn from such a painful state?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>The doubting man replied, “It is my fate.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Strong in her zeal, by texts and reasons back’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>In his grave mood the Doctor she attack’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Cull’d words from Scripture to announce his doom,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bade him “think of dreadful things to come.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“If such,” he answer’d, “be that state untried,</div>
      <div class='line'>In peace, dear Martha, let me here abide;</div>
      <div class='line'>Forbear to insult a man whose fate is known,</div>
      <div class='line'>And leave to Heaven a matter all its own.”      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>In the same cause the Merchant, too, would strive;</div>
      <div class='line'>He ask’d, “Did ever unbeliever thrive?</div>
      <div class='line'>Had he respect? could he a fortune make?</div>
      <div class='line'>And why not then such impious men forsake?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Thanks, my dear James, and be assured I feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>If not your reason, yet at least your zeal;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when those wicked thoughts, that keep me poor,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>And bar respect, assail me as before</div>
      <div class='line'>With force combin’d, you’ll drive the fiend away;</div>
      <div class='line'>For you shall reason, James, and Martha pray.”      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But though the Doctor could reply with ease</div>
      <div class='line'>To all such trivial arguments as these—</div>
      <div class='line'>Though he could reason, or at least deride,</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a power that would not be defied;</div>
      <div class='line'>A closer reasoner, whom he could not shun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could not refute, from whom he could not run:</div>
      <div class='line'>For Conscience lived within; she slept, ’tis true,</div>
      <div class='line'>But when she waked, her pangs awaken’d too.</div>
      <div class='line'>She bade him think; and, as he thought, a sigh</div>
      <div class='line'>Of deep remorse precluded all reply.      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>No soft insulting smile, no bitter jest,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Could this commanding power of strength divest,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But with reluctant fear her terrors he confess’d.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His weak advisers he could scorn or slight,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But not their cause; for, in their folly’s spite,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They took the wiser part, and chose their way aright.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such was the Doctor, upon whom for aid</div>
      <div class='line'>Had some good ladies call’d, but were afraid—</div>
      <div class='line'>Afraid of one who, if report were just,</div>
      <div class='line'>The arm of flesh, and that alone, would trust.      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But these were few—the many took no care</div>
      <div class='line'>Of what they judged to be his own affair;</div>
      <div class='line'>And if he them from their diseases freed,</div>
      <div class='line'>They neither cared nor thought about his creed;</div>
      <div class='line'>They said his merits would for much atone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And only wonder’d that he lived alone.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The widow’d Sister near the Merchant dwelt,</div>
      <div class='line'>And her late loss with lingering sorrow felt.</div>
      <div class='line'>Small was her jointure, and o’er this she sigh’d,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That to her heart its bounteous wish denied,      <span class='linenum'>340}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Which yet all common wants, but not her all, supplied.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Sorrows like showers descend, and as the heart</div>
      <div class='line'>For them prepares, they good or ill impart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some on the mind, as on the ocean rain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fall and disturb, but soon are lost again;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some, as to fertile lands, a boon bestow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And [seeds], that else had perish’d, live and grow;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Some fall on barren soil, and thence proceed</div>
      <div class='line'>The idle blossom, and the useless weed.</div>
      <div class='line'>But how her griefs the Widow’s heart impress’d      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Must from the tenor of her life be guess’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Rigid she was, persisting in her grief,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fond of complaint, and adverse to relief.</div>
      <div class='line'>In her religion she was all severe,</div>
      <div class='line'>And as she was, was anxious to appear.</div>
      <div class='line'>When sorrow died restraint usurp’d the place,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sate in solemn state upon her face.</div>
      <div class='line'>Reading she loved not, nor would deign to waste</div>
      <div class='line'>Her precious time on trifling works of taste;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though what she did with all that precious time      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>We know not, but to waste it was a crime—</div>
      <div class='line'>As oft she said, when with a serious friend</div>
      <div class='line'>She spent the hours as duty bids us spend;</div>
      <div class='line'>To read a novel was a kind of sin—</div>
      <div class='line'>Albeit once Clarissa took her in;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now of late, she heard with much surprise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Novels there were that made a compromise</div>
      <div class='line'>Betwixt amusement and religion: these</div>
      <div class='line'>Might charm the worldly, whom the stories please,</div>
      <div class='line'>And please the serious, whom the sense would charm,      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And thus, indulging, be secured from harm—</div>
      <div class='line'>A happy thought, when from the foe we take</div>
      <div class='line'>His arms, and use them for religion’s sake.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her Bible she perused by day, by night;</div>
      <div class='line'>It was her task—she said ’twas her delight;</div>
      <div class='line'>Found in her room, her chamber, and her pew,</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever studied, yet for ever new—</div>
      <div class='line'>All must be new that we cannot retain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And new we find it when we read again.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The hardest texts she could with ease expound,      <span class='linenum'>380&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And meaning for the most mysterious found,</div>
      <div class='line'>Knew which of dubious senses to prefer.</div>
      <div class='line'>The want of Greek was not a want in her;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Instinctive light no aid from Hebrew needs—</div>
      <div class='line'>But full conviction without study breeds;</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er mortal powers by inborn strength prevails,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where Reason trembles, and where Learning fails.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>To the church strictly from her childhood bred,</div>
      <div class='line'>She now her zeal with party-spirit fed:</div>
      <div class='line'>For brother James she lively hopes express’d,      <span class='linenum'>390&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>One lost, another would her grace implore,</div>

      <div class='line'>But one dear Friend she chose, her guide, her stay</div>
      <div class='line'>And to each other all the world were they;      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For all the world had grown to them unkind,</div>
      <div class='line'>One sex censorious, and the other blind.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Friend of Frances longer time had known</div>
      <div class='line'>The world’s deceits, and from its follies flown.</div>
      <div class='line'>With her dear Friend life’s sober joys to share</div>
      <div class='line'>Was all that now became her wish and care.</div>
      <div class='line'>They walk’d together, they conversed and read,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>And tender tears for well-feign’d sorrows shed:</div>
      <div class='line'>And were so happy in their quiet lives,</div>
      <div class='line'>They pitied sighing maids, and weeping wives.      <span class='linenum'>430&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But Fortune to our state such change imparts,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Pity stays not long in human hearts;</div>
      <div class='line'>When sad for others’ woes our hearts are grown,</div>
      <div class='line'>This soon gives place to sorrows of our own.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There was among our guardian Volunteers</div>
      <div class='line'>A Major Bright—he reckoned fifty years:</div>
      <div class='line'>A reading man of peace, but call’d to take</div>
      <div class='line'>His sword and musket for his country’s sake;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not to go forth and fight, but here to stay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Invaders, should they come, to chase or slay.      <span class='linenum'>440&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Him had the elder Lady long admired,</div>
      <div class='line'>As one from vain and trivial things retired;</div>
      <div class='line'>With him conversed; but to a Friend so dear</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave not that pleasure—Why? is not so clear.</div>
      <div class='line'>But chance effected this; the Major now</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave both the time his duties would allow;</div>
      <div class='line'>In walks, in visits, when abroad, at home,</div>
      <div class='line'>The friendly Major would to either come.</div>
      <div class='line'>He never spoke—for he was not a boy—</div>
      <div class='line'>Of ladies’ charms, or lovers’ grief and joy.      <span class='linenum'>450&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>All his discourses were of serious kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>The heart they touch’d not, but they fill’d the mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet—oh, the pity! from this grave good man</div>
      <div class='line'>The cause of coolness in the Friends began.</div>
      <div class='line'>The sage Sophronia—that the chosen name—</div>
      <div class='line'>Now more polite, and more estranged became.</div>
      <div class='line'>She could but feel that she had longer known</div>
      <div class='line'>This valued friend—he was indeed her own;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Frances Dyson, to confess the truth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had more of softness—yes, and more of youth;      <span class='linenum'>460&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, though he said such things had ceased to please,</div>
      <div class='line'>The worthy Major was not blind to these:</div>
      <div class='line'>So without thought, without intent, he paid</div>
      <div class='line'>More frequent visits to the younger Maid.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such the offence; and, though the Major tried</div>
      <div class='line'>To tie again the knot he thus untied,</div>
      <div class='line'>His utmost efforts no kind looks repaid—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>He moved no more the inexorable maid.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Friends too parted, and the elder told</div>
      <div class='line'>Tales of false hearts, and friendships waxing cold;      <span class='linenum'>470&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And wonder’d what a man of sense could see</div>
      <div class='line'>In the light airs of wither’d vanity.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>’Tis said that Frances now the world reviews,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unwilling all the little left to lose;</div>
      <div class='line'>She and the Major on the walks are seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the world is wondering what they mean.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such were the four whom Captain Elliot drew</div>
      <div class='line'>To his own board, as the selected few.</div>
      <div class='line'>For why? they seem’d each other to approve,</div>
      <div class='line'>And called themselves a Family of Love.      <span class='linenum'>480&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>These were not all: there was a Youth beside,</div>
      <div class='line'>Left to his uncles when his parents died;</div>
      <div class='line'>A Girl, their sister, by a Boy was led      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To Scotland, where a boy and girl may wed—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And they return’d to seek for pardon, pence, and bread.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Five years they lived to labour, weep, and pray,</div>
      <div class='line'>When Death, in mercy, took them both away.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Uncles and aunts received this lively child,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grieved at his fate, and at his follies smiled;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, when the child to boy’s estate grew on,      <span class='linenum'>490&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The smile was vanish’d, and the pity gone.</div>
      <div class='line'>Slight was the burden, but in time increased,</div>
      <div class='line'>Until at length both love and pity ceased.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Tom was idle; he would find his way</div>
      <div class='line'>To his aunt’s stores, and make her sweets his prey;</div>
      <div class='line'>By uncle Doctor on a message sent,</div>
      <div class='line'>He stopp’d to play, and lost it as he went.</div>
      <div class='line'>His grave aunt Martha, with a frown austere</div>
      <div class='line'>And a rough hand, produced a transient fear;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Tom, to whom his rude companions taught      <span class='linenum'>500&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Language as rude, vindictive measures sought;</div>
      <div class='line'>He used such words that, when she wish’d to speak</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his offence, she had her words to seek.</div>
      <div class='line'>The little wretch had call’d her—’twas a shame</div>
      <div class='line'>To think such thought, and more to name such name.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus fed and beaten, Tom was taught to pray</div>
      <div class='line'>For his true friends; “but who,” said he, “are they?”</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>By nature kind, when kindly used, the Boy</div>
      <div class='line'>Hail’d the strange good with tears of love and joy;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, roughly used, he felt his bosom burn      <span class='linenum'>510&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With wrath he dared not on his uncles turn;</div>
      <div class='line'>So with indignant spirit, still and strong,</div>
      <div class='line'>He nursed the vengeance, and endured the wrong.</div>
      <div class='line'>To a cheap school, far north, the boy was sent:</div>
      <div class='line'>Without a tear of love or grief he went;</div>
      <div class='line'>Where, doom’d to fast and study, fight and play,</div>
      <div class='line'>He staid five years, and wish’d five more to stay.</div>
      <div class='line'>He loved o’er plains to run, up hills to climb,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without a thought of kindred, home, or time;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till from the cabin of a coasting hoy,      <span class='linenum'>520&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Landed at last the thin and freckled boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>With sharp keen eye, but pale and hollow cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>All made more sad from sickness of a week.</div>
      <div class='line'>His aunts and uncles felt—nor strove to hide</div>
      <div class='line'>From the poor boy, their pity and their pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>He had been taught that he had not a friend</div>
      <div class='line'>Save these on earth, on whom he might depend;</div>
      <div class='line'>And such dependence upon these he had</div>
      <div class='line'>As made him sometimes desperate, always sad.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Awkward and weak, where can the lad be placed,      <span class='linenum'>530&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And we not troubled, censured, or disgraced?</div>
      <div class='line'>Do, Brother James, th’ unhappy boy enrol</div>
      <div class='line'>Among your set; you only can control.”</div>
      <div class='line'>James sigh’d, and Thomas to the Factory went,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who there his days in sundry duties spent.</div>
      <div class='line'>He ran, he wrought, he wrote—to read or play</div>
      <div class='line'>He had no time, nor much to feed or pray.</div>
      <div class='line'>What pass’d without he heard not—or he heard</div>
      <div class='line'>Without concern, what he nor wish’d nor fear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Told of the Captain and his wealth, he sigh’d,      <span class='linenum'>540&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And said, “how well his table is supplied!”</div>
      <div class='line'>But with the sigh it caused the sorrow fled;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He was not feasted, but he must be fed;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And he could sleep full sound, though not full soft his bed.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But still, ambitious thoughts his mind possess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dreams of joy broke in upon his rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>Improved in person, and enlarged in mind,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The good he found not he could hope to find;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though now enslaved, he hail’d the approaching day,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he should break his chains and flee away.      <span class='linenum'>550&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such were the Dysons: they were first of those</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom Captain Elliot as companions chose;</div>
      <div class='line'>Them he invited, and the more approved,</div>
      <div class='line'>As it appear’d that each the other loved.</div>
      <div class='line'>Proud of their brothers were the sister pair;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if not proud, yet kind the brothers were.</div>
      <div class='line'>This pleased the Captain, who had never known,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or he had loved, such kindred of his own;</div>
      <div class='line'>Them he invited, save the Orphan lad,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose name was not the one his Uncles had;      <span class='linenum'>560&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>No Dyson he, nor with the party came—</div>
      <div class='line'>The worthy Captain never heard his name;</div>
      <div class='line'>Uncles and Aunts forbore to name the boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>For then, of course, must follow his employ.</div>
      <div class='line'>Though all were silent, as with one consent,</div>
      <div class='line'>None told another what his silence meant,</div>
      <div class='line'>What hers; but each suppress’d the useless truth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And not a word was mentioned of the youth.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Familiar grown, the Dysons saw their host,</div>
      <div class='line'>With none beside them; it became their boast,      <span class='linenum'>570&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Their pride, their pleasure; but to some it seem’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Beyond the worth their talents were esteem’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>This wrought no change within the Captain’s mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>To all men courteous, he to them was kind.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One day with these he sat, and only these,</div>
      <div class='line'>In a light humour, talking at his ease.</div>
      <div class='line'>Familiar grown, he was disposed to tell</div>
      <div class='line'>Of times long past, and what in them befell—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not of his life their wonder to attract,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the choice tale, or insulated fact.      <span class='linenum'>580&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then, as it seem’d, he had acquired a right</div>
      <div class='line'>To hear what they could from their stores recite.</div>
      <div class='line'>Their lives, they said, were all of common kind;</div>
      <div class='line'>He could no pleasure in such trifles find.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They had an Uncle—’tis their father’s tale—</div>
      <div class='line'>Who in all seas had gone where ship can sail;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who in all lands had been, where men can live;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“He could indeed some strange relations give,</div>
      <div class='line'>And many a bold adventure; but in vain</div>
      <div class='line'>We look for him; he comes not home again.”      <span class='linenum'>590&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And is it so? why then, if so it be,”</div>
      <div class='line'>Said Captain Elliot, “you must look to me:</div>
      <div class='line'>I knew John Dyson”——Instant every one</div>
      <div class='line'>Was moved to wonder—“Knew my Uncle John!</div>
      <div class='line'>Can he be rich? be childless? he is old,</div>
      <div class='line'>That is most certain—What! can more be told?</div>
      <div class='line'>Will he return, who has so long been gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lost to us? Oh! what of Uncle John?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This was aside: their unobservant friend</div>
      <div class='line'>Seem’d on their thoughts but little to attend;      <span class='linenum'>600&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A traveller speaking, he was more inclined</div>
      <div class='line'>To tell his story than their thoughts to find.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Although, my Friends, I love you well, ’tis true,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas your relation turn’d my mind to you;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For we were friends of old, and friends like us are few;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, though from dearest friends a man will hide</div>
      <div class='line'>His private vices in his native pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet such our friendship from its early rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>We no reserve admitted, no disguise;</div>
      <div class='line'>But ’tis the story of my friend I tell,      <span class='linenum'>610&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And to all others let me bid farewell.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Take each your glass, and you shall hear how John,</div>
      <div class='line'>My old companion, through the world has gone;</div>
      <div class='line'>I can describe him to the very life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Him and his ways, his ventures, and his wife.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Wife!” whisper’d all; “then what his life to us,</div>
      <div class='line'>His ways and ventures, if he ventured thus?”</div>
      <div class='line'>This, too, apart; yet were they all intent,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, gravely listening, sigh’d with one consent.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“My friend, your Uncle, was design’d for trade,      <span class='linenum'>620&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To make a fortune as his father made;</div>

      <div class='line'>And his domestic views at once resign’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>While stout of heart, with life in every limb,</div>
      <div class='line'>He would to sea, and either sink or swim.</div>
      <div class='line'>No one forbad; his father shook his hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Within it leaving what he could command.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“He left his home, but I will not relate</div>

      <div class='line'>Till his brave frigate was a Spanish prize,      <span class='linenum'>630&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And prison-walls received his first-born sighs—</div>
      <div class='line'>Sighs for the freedom that an English boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or English man, is eager to enjoy.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Exchanged, he breathed in freedom, and aboard</div>

      <div class='line'>Again ’twas war: of France a ship appear’d      <span class='linenum'>640&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of greater force, but neither shunn’d nor fear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas in the Indian Sea, the land was nigh,</div>

      <div class='line'>Forth then they went to see him, and persuade—</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Some days elaps’d; the Captain did not write,</div>

      <div class='line'>Hard is their work, and very hard their fare.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But then,” said Thomas, “if on land, I doubt</div>
      <div class='line'>My Uncle Dyson soon would find me out;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, though he tells me what I yearly cost,      <span class='linenum'>970&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis my belief he’d miss me were I lost.</div>
      <div class='line'>For he has said, that I can act as well</div>
      <div class='line'>As he himself—but this you must not tell.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Tell, Thomas! no, I scorn the base design,</div>
      <div class='line'>Give me your hand, I pledge my word with mine;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if I cannot do thee good, my friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou may’st at least upon that word depend.</div>
      <div class='line'>And hark ye, lad, thy worthy name retain</div>
      <div class='line'>To the last hour, or I shall help in vain;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then the more severe and hard thy part,      <span class='linenum'>980&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Thine the more praise, and thine the happier art.</div>
      <div class='line'>We meet again—farewell!”—and Thomas went</div>
      <div class='line'>Forth to his tasks, half angry, half content.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I never ask’d for help,” thought he, “but twice,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all they then would give me was advice;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>My Uncle Doctor, when I begg’d his aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bade me work on, and never be afraid,</div>
      <div class='line'>But still be good; and I’ve been good so long,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m half persuaded that they tell me wrong.</div>
      <div class='line'>And now this Captain still repeats the same;      <span class='linenum'>990&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But who can live upon a virtuous name,</div>
      <div class='line'>Starving and praised?—‘have patience—patience still!’</div>
      <div class='line'>He said, and smiled; and, if I can, I will.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So Thomas rested with a mind intent</div>
      <div class='line'>On what the Captain by his kindness meant.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Again the invited party all attend,</div>
      <div class='line'>These dear relations, on this generous Friend.</div>
      <div class='line'>They ate, they drank, each striving to appear</div>
      <div class='line'>Fond, frank, forgiving—above all, sincere.</div>
      <div class='line'>Such kindred souls could not admit disguise,      <span class='linenum'>1000&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or envious fears, or painful jealousies;</div>
      <div class='line'>So each declared, and all in turn replied,</div>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis just indeed, and cannot be denied.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now various subjects rose—the country’s cause,</div>
      <div class='line'>The war, the allies, the lottery, and the laws.</div>
      <div class='line'>The widow’d Sister then advantage took</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a short pause, and, smiling softly, spoke:</div>
      <div class='line'>She judged what subject would his mind excite—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Tell us, dear Captain, of that bloody fight,</div>
      <div class='line'>When our brave Uncle, bleeding at his gun,      <span class='linenum'>1010&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Gave a loud shout to see the Frenchmen run.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Another day”—replied the modest host;</div>
      <div class='line'>“One cannot always of one’s battles boast.</div>
      <div class='line'>Look not surprise—behold the man in me!</div>
      <div class='line'>Another Uncle shall you never see.</div>
      <div class='line'>No other Dyson to this place shall come;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here end my travels, here I place my home;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here to repose my shatter’d frame I mean,</div>
      <div class='line'>Until the last long journey close the scene.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Ladies softly brush’d the tear away;      <span class='linenum'>1020&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>James look’d surprise, but knew not what to say;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Doctor Dyson lifted up his voice,</div>
      <div class='line'>And said, “Dear Uncle, how we all rejoice!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“No question, Friends! and I your joy approve,</div>
      <div class='line'>We are, you know, a Family of Love.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>So said the wary Uncle, but the while      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Wore on his face a questionable smile,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That vanish’d, as he spake in grave and solemn style—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Friends and relations! let us henceforth seem</div>
      <div class='line'>Just as we are, nor of our virtues dream,      <span class='linenum'>1030&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That with our waking vanish.—What we are</div>
      <div class='line'>Full well we know—t’ improve it be our care.</div>
      <div class='line'>Forgive the trial I have made: ’tis one</div>
      <div class='line'>That has no more than I expected done.</div>
      <div class='line'>If as frail mortals you, my Friends, appear,</div>
      <div class='line'>I look’d for no angelic beings here,</div>
      <div class='line'>For none that riches spurn’d as idle pelf,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or served another as he served himself.</div>
      <div class='line'>Deceived no longer, let us all forgive;</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m old, but yet a tedious time may live.      <span class='linenum'>1040&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>This dark complexion India’s suns bestow,</div>
      <div class='line'>These shrivell’d looks to years of care I owe;</div>
      <div class='line'>But no disease ensures my early doom—</div>
      <div class='line'>And I may live—forgive me—years to come.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, while I live, there may some good be done,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perchance to many, but at least to One.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Here he arose, retired, return’d, and brought</div>
      <div class='line'>The Orphan boy, whom he had train’d and taught</div>
      <div class='line'>For this his purpose; and the happy boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though bade to hide, could ill suppress, his joy.—      <span class='linenum'>1050&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“This young relation, with your leave, I take,</div>
      <div class='line'>That he his progress in the world may make—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not in my house a slave or spy to be,</div>
      <div class='line'>And first to flatter, then to govern me;—</div>
      <div class='line'>He shall not nurse me when my senses sleep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor shall the key of all my secrets keep,</div>
      <div class='line'>And be so useful that a dread to part</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall make him master of my easy heart;—</div>
      <div class='line'>But to be placed where merit may be proved,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all that now impedes his way removed.      <span class='linenum'>1060&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And now no more on these affairs I dwell;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What I possess that I alone can tell,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And to that subject we will bid farewell.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As go I must, when Heaven is pleased to call,</div>
      <div class='line'>What I shall leave will seem or large or small,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>“And now, as Captain Elliot much has known,</div>

      <div class='line'>And men adventurous treat as lawful game—</div>
      <div class='line'>Misses, who strive, with deep and practised arts,</div>
      <div class='line'>To gain and torture inexperienced hearts.</div>
      <div class='line'>The hearts entangled they in pride retain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And at their pleasure make them feel their chain;</div>
      <div class='line'>For this they learn to manage air and face,</div>
      <div class='line'>To look a virtue, and to act a grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>To be whatever men with warmth pursue—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Chaste, gay, retiring, tender, timid, true,      <span class='linenum'>10}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To-day approaching near, to-morrow just in view.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Maria Glossip was a thing like this—</div>
      <div class='line'>A much observing, much experienced Miss;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who on a stranger-youth would first decide</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ important question—“Shall I be his bride?”</div>
      <div class='line'>But, if unworthy of a lot so bless’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas something yet to rob the man of rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>The heart, when stricken, she with hope could feed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could court pursuit, and, when pursued, recede.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hearts she had won, and with delusion fed,      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With doubt bewilder’d, and with hope misled;</div>
      <div class='line'>Mothers and rivals she had made afraid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wrung the breast of many a jealous maid;</div>
      <div class='line'>Friendship, the snare of lovers, she profess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>And turn’d the heart’s best feelings to a jest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet seem’d the Nymph as gentle as a dove,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like one all guiltless of the game of love—</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose guileless innocence might well be gay;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who had no selfish secrets to betray;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Sure, if she play’d, she knew not how to play.      <span class='linenum'>30}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! she had looks so placid and demure,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not Eve, ere fallen, seem’d more meek or pure;</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet the Tempter of the falling Eve</div>
      <div class='line'>Could not with deeper subtilty deceive.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A Sailor’s heart the Lady’s kindness moved,</div>
      <div class='line'>And winning looks, to say how well he loved;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then left her hopeful for the stormy main,</div>
      <div class='line'>Assured of love when he return’d again.</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! the gay Lieutenant reach’d the shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>To be rejected, and was gay no more;      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Wine and strong drink the bosom’s pain suppress’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till Death procured, what Love denied him—rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>But men of more experience learn to treat</div>
      <div class='line'>These fair enslavers with their own deceit.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Finch was a younger brother’s youngest son,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who pleased an Uncle with his song and gun;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who call’d him ‘Bob,’ and ‘Captain,’ by that name</div>
      <div class='line'>Anticipating future rank and fame;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not but there was for this some fair pretence—</div>
      <div class='line'>He was a cornet in the Home Defence.      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The Youth was ever drest in dapper style,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wore spotless linen, and a ceaseless smile;</div>
      <div class='line'>His step was measured, and his air was nice—</div>
      <div class='line'>They bought him high, who had him at the price</div>
      <div class='line'>That his own judgment and becoming pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the merit he assumed, implied.</div>
      <div class='line'>A life he loved of liberty and ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all his pleasant labour was to please;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not call’d at present hostile men to slay,</div>
      <div class='line'>He made the hearts of gentle dames his prey.      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hence tales arose, and one of sad report:</div>
      <div class='line'>A fond, fair girl became his folly’s sport—</div>
      <div class='line'>A cottage lass, who “knew the youth would prove</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever true, and give her love for love;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Sure when he could, and that would soon be known,</div>
      <div class='line'>He would be proud to show her as his own.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But still she felt the village damsels’ sneer,</div>
      <div class='line'>And her sad soul was fill’d with secret fear;</div>
      <div class='line'>His love excepted, earth was all a void,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he, the excepted man, her peace destroy’d.      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When the poor Jane was buried, we could hear</div>
      <div class='line'>The threat of rustics whisper’d round her bier.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Stories like this were told, but yet, in time</div>
      <div class='line'>Fair ladies lost their horror at the crime.</div>
      <div class='line'>They knew that cottage girls were forward things,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who never heed a nettle till it stings;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, too, the Captain had his fault confess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And scorn’d to turn a murder to a jest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Away with murder!—This accomplish’d swain</div>
      <div class='line'>Beheld Maria, and confess’d her reign—      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She came, invited by the rector’s wife,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who “never saw such sweetness in her life.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Now, as the rector was the Uncle’s friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>It pleased the Nephew there his steps to bend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the fair damsel then her visit paid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And seem’d an unassuming rustic maid.</div>
      <div class='line'>A face so fair, a look so meek, he found</div>
      <div class='line'>Had pierced that heart no other nymph could wound.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Oh, sweet Maria”—so began the Youth</div>
      <div class='line'>His meditations—“thine the simple truth!      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Thou hast no wicked wisdom of thy sex,</div>
      <div class='line'>No wish to gain a subject-heart—then vex.</div>
      <div class='line'>That heavenly bosom no proud passion swells;</div>
      <div class='line'>No serpent’s wisdom with thy meekness dwells.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! could I bind thee to my heart, and live</div>
      <div class='line'>In love with thee, on what our fortunes give!</div>
      <div class='line'>Far from the busy world, in some dear spot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where Love reigns king, we’d find some peaceful cot.</div>
      <div class='line'>To wed, indeed, no prudent man would choose;</div>
      <div class='line'>But such a maid will lighter bonds refuse!”      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>And was this youth a rake?—In very truth;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, feeling love, he felt it as a youth;</div>
      <div class='line'>If he had vices, they were laid aside;</div>
      <div class='line'>He quite forgot the simple girl who died;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>With dear Maria he in peace would live,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what had pass’d—Maria would forgive.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The fair Coquette at first was pleased to find</div>
      <div class='line'>A swain so knowing had become so blind;</div>
      <div class='line'>And she determined, with her utmost skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>To bind the rebel to her sovereign will.      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She heard the story of the old deceit,</div>
      <div class='line'>And now resolved he should with justice meet;—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Soon as she saw him on her hook secure,</div>
      <div class='line'>He should the pangs of perjured man endure.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>These her first thoughts—but as, from time to time,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lover came, she dwelt not on his crime—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Crime could she call it? prudes, indeed, condemn</div>
      <div class='line'>These slips of youth—but she was not of them.”</div>
      <div class='line'>So gentler thoughts arose as, day by day,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Captain came his passion to display.      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When he display’d his passion, and she felt,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not without fear, her heart begin to melt—</div>
      <div class='line'>Joy came with terror at a state so new;</div>
      <div class='line'>Glad of his truth; if he indeed were true!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This she decided as the heart decides,</div>
      <div class='line'>Resolved to be the happiest of brides.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Not great my fortune—hence,” said she, “’tis plain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Me, and not mine, dear Youth! he hopes to gain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor has he much; but, as he sweetly talks,</div>
      <div class='line'>We from our cot shall have delightful walks,      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Love, lord within it! I shall smile to see</div>
      <div class='line'>My little cherubs on the father’s knee.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then sigh’d the nymph, and in her fancied lot,</div>
      <div class='line'>She all the mischiefs of the past forgot.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such were their tender meditations; thus</div>
      <div class='line'>Would they the visions of the day discuss:</div>
      <div class='line'>Each, too, the old sad habits would no more</div>
      <div class='line'>Indulge; both dare be virtuous and be poor.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They both had past the year when law allows</div>
      <div class='line'>Free-will to lover who would fain be spouse:      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet the good youth his Uncle’s sanction sought—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Marry her, Bob! and are you really caught?</div>
      <div class='line'>Then you’ve exchanged, I warrant, heart for heart—</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis well! I meant to warn her of your art;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>This Parson’s Babe has made you quite a fool—</div>
      <div class='line'>But are you sure your ardour will not cool?</div>
      <div class='line'>Have you not habits, Boy? but take your chance!</div>
      <div class='line'>How will you live? I cannot much advance.</div>
      <div class='line'>But hear you not what through the village flies</div>
      <div class='line'>That this your dove is famed for her disguise?      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, say they not, she leads a gayish life?</div>
      <div class='line'>Art sure she’ll show the virtues of a wife?”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Oh, Sir, she’s all that mortal man can love!”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Then marry, Bob! and that the fact will prove—</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, in a kind of lightness, folk agree.”—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Lightness in her! indeed, it cannot be—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis Innocence alone that makes her manners free.”—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Well, my good friend! then Innocence alone</div>
      <div class='line'>Is to a something like Flirtation prone;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I advise—but let me not offend—      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That Prudence should on Innocence attend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lest some her sportive purity mistake,</div>
      <div class='line'>And term your angel more than half a rake.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Nymph, now sure, could not entirely curb</div>
      <div class='line'>The native wish her lover to disturb.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft he observed her, and could ill endure</div>
      <div class='line'>The gentle coquetry of maid so pure:</div>
      <div class='line'>Men he beheld press round her, and the Fair</div>
      <div class='line'>Caught every sigh, and smiled at every prayer;</div>
      <div class='line'>And grieved he was with jealous pains to see      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The effects of all her wit and pleasantry.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Yet why alarm’d?”—he said; “with so much sense,</div>
      <div class='line'>She has no freedom, dashing, or pretence:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis her gay mind, and I should feel a pride</div>
      <div class='line'>In her chaste levities”—he said, and sigh’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, when apart from company, he chose</div>
      <div class='line'>To talk a little of his bosom’s woes—</div>
      <div class='line'>But one sweet smile, and one soft speech, suppress’d</div>
      <div class='line'>All pain, and set his feeling heart at rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, in return, she felt, or feign’d, a fear:      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“He was too lively to be quite sincere—</div>
      <div class='line'>She knew a certain lady, and could name      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A certain time”—So, even was the blame,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And thus the loving pair more deep in love became.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>They married soon—for why delay the thing      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That such amazing happiness would bring?—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Now of that blissful state, O Muse of Hymen! sing.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Love dies all kinds of death: in some so quick</div>
      <div class='line'>It comes—he is not previously sick;</div>
      <div class='line'>But ere the sun has on the couple shed      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The morning rays, the smile of Love is fled.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And what the cause? for Love should not expire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And none the reason of such fate require.</div>
      <div class='line'>Both had a mask, that with such pains they wore;</div>
      <div class='line'>Each took it off when it avail’d no more.</div>
      <div class='line'>They had no feeling of each other’s pain;</div>
      <div class='line'>To wear it longer had been crime in vain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As in some pleasant eve we view the scene,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though cool yet calm, if joyless yet serene—</div>
      <div class='line'>Who has not felt a quiet still delight      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In the clear, silent, love-befriending night?</div>
      <div class='line'>The moon so sweetly bright, so softly fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>That all but happy lovers would be there—</div>
      <div class='line'>Thinking there must be in her still domain</div>
      <div class='line'>Something that soothes the sting of mortal pain;</div>
      <div class='line'>While earth itself is dress’d in light so clear,</div>
      <div class='line'>That they might rest contented to be here!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such is the night; but, when the morn awakes,</div>
      <div class='line'>The storm arises, and the forest shakes;</div>
      <div class='line'>This mighty change the grieving travellers find,      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The freezing snows fast drifting in the wind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Firs deeply laden shake the snowy top,</div>
      <div class='line'>Streams slowly freezing, fretting till they stop;</div>
      <div class='line'>And void of stars the angry clouds look down</div>
      <div class='line'>On the cold earth, exchanging frown with frown.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such seem’d, at first, the cottage of our pair—</div>
      <div class='line'>Fix’d in their fondness, in their prospects fair;</div>
      <div class='line'>Youth, health, affection, all that life supplies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bright as the stars that gild the cloudless skies—</div>
      <div class='line'>Were theirs—or seem’d to be; but soon the scene      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Was black as if its light had never been.</div>
      <div class='line'>Weary full soon, and restless then, they grew;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then off the painful mask of prudence threw;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For Time has told them all, and taught them what to rue.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>They long again to tread the former round</div>
      <div class='line'>Of dissipation—“Why should he be bound,</div>
      <div class='line'>While his sweet inmate of the cottage sighs</div>
      <div class='line'>For adulation, rout, and rhapsodies?</div>
      <div class='line'>Not Love himself, did love exist, could lead</div>
      <div class='line'>A heart like hers, that flutter’d to be freed.”      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But Love, or what seem’d like him, quickly died;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor Prudence, nor Esteem, his place supplied.</div>
      <div class='line'>Disguise thrown off, each reads the other’s heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>And feels with horror that they cannot part.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Still they can speak—and ’tis some comfort still,</div>
      <div class='line'>That each can vex the other when they will:</div>
      <div class='line'>Words half in jest to words in earnest led,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And these the earnest angry passions fed,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Till all was fierce reproach, and peace for ever fled.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And so you own it! own it to my face,      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Your love is vanish’d—infamous and base!”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Madam, I loved you truly, while I deem’d</div>
      <div class='line'>You were the truthful being that you seem’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, when I see your native temper rise</div>
      <div class='line'>Above control, and break through all disguise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Casting it off, as serpents do their skin,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And showing all the folds of vice within—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What see I then to love? was I in love with Sin?”—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“So may I think, and you may feel it too;</div>
      <div class='line'>A loving couple, Sir, were Sin and you!      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Whence all this anger? is it that you find</div>
      <div class='line'>You cannot always make a woman blind?</div>
      <div class='line'>You talk of falsehood and disguise—talk on!</div>
      <div class='line'>But all my trust and confidence are gone;</div>
      <div class='line'>Remember you, with what a serious air</div>
      <div class='line'>You talk’d of love, as if you were at prayer?</div>
      <div class='line'>You spoke of home-born comforts, quiet, ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the pure pleasure, that must always please,</div>
      <div class='line'>With an assumed and sentimental air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Smiting your breast, and acting like a player.      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then your life’s comfort! and your holy joys!</div>
      <div class='line'>Holy, forsooth! and your sweet girls and boys,</div>
      <div class='line'>How you would train them!—All this farce review,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then, Sir, talk of being just and true!”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>“Madam! your sex expects that ours should lie.</div>
      <div class='line'>The simple creatures know it, and comply—</div>
      <div class='line'>You hate the truth; there’s nothing you despise</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a plain man, who spurns your vanities.</div>
      <div class='line'>Are you not early taught your prey to catch?</div>
      <div class='line'>When your mammas pronounce—‘A proper match!’      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What said your own?—‘Do, daughter! curb your tongue,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>“Then is the mask assumed, and then you bait</div>
      <div class='line'>Your hook with kindness! and as anglers wait,</div>

      <div class='line'>Marking your victims as the shoals advance;</div>
      <div class='line'>When, if the gaping wretch should make a snap,</div>
      <div class='line'>You jerk him up, and have him in your trap:      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who gasping, panting, in your presence lies,</div>
      <div class='line'>And you exulting view the imprison’d prize.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Such are your arts! while he did but intend</div>
      <div class='line'>In harmless play an idle hour to spend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lightly to talk of love! your fix’d intent      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Is on to lure him, where he never meant      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To go, but, going, must his speed repent.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>If he of Cupid speaks, you watch your man,</div>

      <div class='line'>Thus he, ingenuous, easy, fond, and weak,      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Speaks the rash words he has been led to speak;</div>
      <div class='line'>Puts the dire question that he meant to shun,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>“Well!” said the Wife, “admit this nonsense true—</div>
      <div class='line'>A mighty prize she gains in catching you!</div>
      <div class='line'>For my part, Sir, I most sincerely wish</div>
      <div class='line'>My landing-net had miss’d my precious fish!”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Would that it had! or I had wisely lent</div>

      <div class='line'>Such the good name that you so much regard,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>I</span>t chanced we walk’d upon the heath, and met</div>
      <div class='line'>A wandering woman; her thin clothing wet</div>
      <div class='line'>With morning fog; the little care she took</div>
      <div class='line'>Of things like these was written in her look.</div>
      <div class='line'>Not pain from pinching cold was in her face,</div>
      <div class='line'>But hurrying grief, that knows no resting place—</div>
      <div class='line'>Appearing ever as on business sent,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wandering victim of a fix’d intent;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet in her fancied consequence and speed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Impell’d to beg assistance for her need.      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>When she beheld my friend and me, with eye</div>
      <div class='line'>And pleading hand she sought our charity;</div>
      <div class='line'>More to engage our friendly thoughts the while,</div>
      <div class='line'>She threw upon her miseries a smile,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, like a varnish on a picture laid,</div>
      <div class='line'>More prominent and bold the figures made;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet was there sign of joy that we complied,</div>
      <div class='line'>The moment’s wish indulged and gratified.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Where art thou wandering, Rachel? whither stray,</div>
      <div class='line'>From thy poor heath in such unwholesome day?”      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Ask’d my kind friend, who had familiar grown</div>
      <div class='line'>With Rachel’s grief, and oft compassion shown;</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft to her hovel had in winter sent</div>
      <div class='line'>The means of comfort—oft with comforts went.</div>
      <div class='line'>Him well she knew, and with requests pursued,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though too much lost and spent for gratitude.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Where art thou wandering, Rachel? let me hear?”—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“The fleet! the fleet!” she answer’d, “will appear</div>
      <div class='line'>Within the bay, and I shall surely know</div>
      <div class='line'>The news to-night!—turn tide, and breezes blow!      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For if I lose my time, I must remain</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the next year before they come again!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“What can they tell thee, Rachel?”—</div>
      <div class='line in30'>“Should I say,</div>
      <div class='line'>I must repent me to my dying day.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then I should lose the pension that they give;</div>
      <div class='line'>For who would trust their secrets to a sieve?</div>
      <div class='line'>I must be gone!”—And with her wild, but keen</div>
      <div class='line'>And crafty look, that would appear to mean,</div>
      <div class='line'>She hurried on; but turn’d again to say,</div>
      <div class='line'>“All will be known; they anchor in the bay;      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Adieu! be secret!—sailors have no home;</div>
      <div class='line'>Blow wind, turn tide!—Be sure the fleet will come.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Grown wilder still, the frantic creature strode</div>
      <div class='line'>With hurried feet upon the flinty road.</div>
      <div class='line'>On her departing form I gazed with pain—</div>
      <div class='line'>“And should you not,” I cried, “her ways restrain?</div>
      <div class='line'>What hopes the wild deluded wretch to meet?</div>
      <div class='line'>And means she aught by this expected fleet?</div>
      <div class='line'>Knows she her purpose? has she hope to see</div>
      <div class='line'>Some friend to aid her in her poverty?      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Why leave her thus bewilder’d to pursue</div>
      <div class='line'>The fancy’s good, that never comes in view?”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Nay! she is harmless, and, if more confined,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would more distress in the coercion find.</div>
      <div class='line'>Save at the times when to the coast she flies,</div>
      <div class='line'>She rests, nor shows her mind’s obliquities;</div>
      <div class='line'>But ever talks she of the sea, and shows</div>
      <div class='line'>Her sympathy with every wind that blows.</div>
      <div class='line'>We think it, therefore, useless to restrain</div>
      <div class='line'>A creature of whose conduct none complain;      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Whose age and looks protect her—should they fail,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her craft and wild demeanour will prevail.</div>
      <div class='line'>A soldier once attack’d her on her way—</div>
      <div class='line'>She spared him not, but bade him kneel and pray—</div>
      <div class='line'>Praying herself aloud—th’ astonish’d man</div>
      <div class='line'>Was so confounded, that away he ran.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“Her sailor left her, with, perhaps, intent</div>
      <div class='line'>To make her his—’tis doubtful what he meant:</div>
      <div class='line'>But he was captured, and the life he led</div>
      <div class='line'>Drove all such young engagements from his head.      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>On him she ever thought, and none beside,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seeking her love, were favour’d or denied;</div>
      <div class='line'>On her dear David she had fix’d her view,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fancy judged him ever fond and true.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, young and handsome—Time could not destroy—</div>
      <div class='line'>No—he was still the same—her gallant boy!</div>
      <div class='line'>Labour had made her coarse, and her attire</div>
      <div class='line'>Show’d that she wanted no one to admire;</div>
      <div class='line'>None to commend her; but she could conceive</div>
      <div class='line'>The same of him, as when he took his leave,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And gaily told what riches he would bring,</div>
      <div class='line'>And grace her hand with the symbolic ring.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“With want and labour was her mind subdued;</div>
      <div class='line'>She lived in sorrow and in solitude.</div>
      <div class='line'>Religious neighbours, kindly calling, found</div>
      <div class='line'>Her thoughts unsettled, anxious, and unsound;</div>
      <div class='line'>Low, superstitious, querulous, and weak,</div>
      <div class='line'>She sought for rest, but knew not how to seek;</div>
      <div class='line'>And their instructions, though in kindness meant</div>
      <div class='line'>Were far from yielding the desired content.      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They hoped to give her notions of their own,</div>
      <div class='line'>And talk’d of ‘feelings’ she had never known;</div>
      <div class='line'>They ask’d of her ‘experience,’ and they bred</div>
      <div class='line'>In her weak mind a melancholy dread</div>
      <div class='line'>Of something wanting in her faith, of some—</div>
      <div class='line'>She knew not what—‘acceptance,’ that should come;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as it came not, she was much afraid</div>
      <div class='line'>That she in vain had served her God and pray’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“She thought her Lover dead. In prayer she named</div>
      <div class='line'>The erring Youth, and hoped he was reclaim’d.      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>This she confess’d; and trembling, heard them say,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Her prayers were sinful—So the papists pray.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her David’s fate had been decided long,</div>
      <div class='line'>And prayers and wishes for his state were wrong.’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Had these her guides united love and skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>They might have ruled and rectified her will;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>But they perceived not the bewilder’d mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And show’d her paths that she could never find.</div>
      <div class='line'>The weakness that was Nature’s, they reproved,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all its comforts from the Heart removed.      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Ev’n in this state, she loved the winds that sweep</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er the wild heath, and curl the restless deep;</div>
      <div class='line'>A turf-built hut beneath a hill she chose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And oft at night in winter storms arose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hearing, or dreaming, the distracted cry</div>
      <div class='line'>Of drowning seamen on the breakers by;</div>
      <div class='line'>For there were rocks, that when the tides were low</div>
      <div class='line'>Appear’d, and vanish’d when the waters flow;</div>
      <div class='line'>And there she stood, all patient to behold</div>
      <div class='line'>Some seaman’s body on the billows roll’d.      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“One calm, cold evening, when the moon was high,</div>
      <div class='line'>And rode sublime within the cloudless sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>She sat within her hut, nor seem’d to feel</div>
      <div class='line'>Or cold or want, but turn’d her idle wheel,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with sad song its melancholy tone</div>
      <div class='line'>Mix’d, all unconscious that she dwelt alone.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But none will harm her—Or who, willing can?</div>
      <div class='line'>She is too wretched to have fear of man—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not man! but something—if it should appear,</div>
      <div class='line'>That once was man—that something did she fear.      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“No causeless terror!—In that moon’s clear light</div>
      <div class='line'>It came, and seem’d a parley to invite;</div>
      <div class='line'>It was no hollow voice—no brushing by</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a strange being, who escapes the eye—</div>
      <div class='line'>No cold or thrilling touch, that will but last</div>
      <div class='line'>While we can think, and then for ever past.</div>
      <div class='line'>But this sad face—though not the same she knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Enough the same to prove the vision true—</div>
      <div class='line'>Look’d full upon her!—starting in affright</div>
      <div class='line'>She fled, her wildness doubling at the sight;      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With shrieks of terror, and emotion strong,</div>
      <div class='line'>She pass’d it by, and madly rush’d along</div>
      <div class='line'>To the bare rocks—While David, who, that day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had left his ship at anchor in the bay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had seen his friends who yet survived, and heard</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her who loved him—and who thus appear’d—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>He tried to soothe her, but retired afraid</div>
      <div class='line'>T’ approach, and left her to return for aid.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“None came! and Rachel in the morn was found      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Turning her wheel, without its spindles, round,      <span class='linenum'>150}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With household look of care, low singing to the sound.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Since that event, she is what you have seen;</div>
      <div class='line'>But time and habit make her more serene,</div>
      <div class='line'>The edge of anguish blunted—yet, it seems,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sea, ships, and sailors’ miseries are her dreams.”</div>

      <div class='line'><i>Poet.</i> <span class='c023'>K</span>now you the fate of Villars?—</div>
      <div class='line in30'><i>Friend.</i> What! the lad</div>
      <div class='line'>At school so fond of solitude, and sad;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who broke our bounds because he scorn’d a guide,</div>
      <div class='line'>And would walk lonely by the river’s side?—</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>P.</i> The same!—who rose at midnight to behold</div>
      <div class='line'>The moonbeams shedding their ethereal gold;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who held our sports and pleasures in disgrace,</div>
      <div class='line'>For Guy of Warwick, and old Chevy Chase.—</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>F.</i> Who sought for friendships, gave his generous heart</div>
      <div class='line'>To every boy who chose to act the part,      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or judged he felt it—not aware that boys</div>
      <div class='line'>Have poor conceit of intellectual joys.</div>
      <div class='line'>Theirs is no season for superfluous friends,</div>
      <div class='line'>And none they need—but those whom Nature lends.—</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>P.</i> But he, too, loved?—</div>
      <div class='line in24'><i>F.</i> Oh, yes! his friend betray’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The tender passion for the angel-maid.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some child, whose features he at church had seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Became his bosom’s and his fancy’s queen;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some favourite look was on his mind impress’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>His warm and fruitful fondness gave the rest.—      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>P.</i> He left his father?—</div>
      <div class='line in22'><i>F.</i> Yes! and rambled round</div>
      <div class='line'>The land on foot—I know not what he found.</div>
      <div class='line'>Early he came to his paternal land,</div>
      <div class='line'>And took the course he had in rambling plann’d.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Ten years we lost him: he was then employ’d</div>
      <div class='line'>In the wild schemes that he, perhaps, enjoy’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>His mode of life, when he to manhood grew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was all his own—its shape disclosed to few.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Our grave, stern dames, who know the deeds of all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Say that some damsels owe to him their fall;      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, though a Christian in his creed profess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>He had some heathen notions in his breast.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet we may doubt; for women, in his eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were high and glorious, queens and deities;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he, perhaps, adorer and yet man,</div>
      <div class='line'>Transgress’d, yet worshipp’d. There are those who can.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Near him a Widow’s mansion he survey’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>The lovely mother of a lovelier Maid;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not great their wealth, though they were proud to claim</div>
      <div class='line'>Alliance with a house of noblest name.      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now, had I skill, I would right fain devise</div>
      <div class='line'>To bring the highborn spinster to your eyes.</div>
      <div class='line'>I could discourse of lip, and chin, and cheek;</div>
      <div class='line'>But you would see no picture as I speak.</div>
      <div class='line'>Such colours cannot—mix them as I may—</div>
      <div class='line'>Paint you this nymph—We’ll try a different way.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>First take Calista in her glowing charms,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere yet she sank within Lothario’s arms—</div>
      <div class='line'>Endued with beauties ripe, and large desires,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all that feels delight, and that inspires.      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Add Cleopatra’s great, yet tender, soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her boundless pride, her fondness of control,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her daring spirit, and her wily art,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, though it tortures, yet commands the heart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Add woman’s anger for a lover’s slight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the revenge, that insult will excite;</div>
      <div class='line'>Add looks for veils, that she at will could wear,</div>
      <div class='line'>As Juliet fond, as Imogen sincere—</div>
      <div class='line'>Like Portia grave, sententious, and design’d</div>
      <div class='line'>For high affairs, or gay as Rosalind—      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Catch, if you can, some notion of the dame,</div>
      <div class='line'>And let Matilda serve her for a name.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Think next how Villars saw th’ enchanting maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And how he loved, pursued, adored, obey’d—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Obey’d in all, except the dire command,</div>
      <div class='line'>No more to dream of that bewitching hand.</div>
      <div class='line'>His love provoked her scorn, his wealth she spurn’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And frowns for praise, contempt for prayer return’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, proud yet shrewd, the wily sex despise</div>
      <div class='line'>The would-be husband—yet the votary prize.      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As Roman conquerors, of their triumph vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Saw humbled monarchs in their pompous train,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who, when no more they swell’d the show of pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>In secret sorrow’d, or in silence died:</div>
      <div class='line'>So, when our friend adored the Beauty’s shrine,</div>
      <div class='line'>She mark’d the act, and gave the nod divine;</div>
      <div class='line'>And strove with scatter’d smiles, yet scarcely strove,</div>
      <div class='line'>To keep the lover, while she scorn’d his love.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>These, and his hope, the doubtful man sustain’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>For who that loves believes himself disdain’d?—      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Each look, each motion, by his fondness read,</div>
      <div class='line'>Became Love’s food, and greater fondness bred;</div>
      <div class='line'>The pettiest favour was to him the sign,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of secret love, and said, “I’ll yet be thine!”</div>
      <div class='line'>One doleful year she held the captive swain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who felt and cursed, and wore and bless’d, the chain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who pass’d a thousand galling insults by,</div>
      <div class='line'>For one kind glance of that ambiguous eye.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>P.</i> Well! time, perhaps, might to the coldest heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Some gentle thought of one so fond impart;      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And pride itself has often favour shown</div>
      <div class='line'>To what it governs, and can call its own.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>F.</i> Thus were they placed, when to the village came</div>
      <div class='line'>That lordly stranger, whom I need not name;</div>
      <div class='line'>Known since too well, but then as rich and young,</div>
      <div class='line'>Untried his prowess, and his crimes unsung.</div>
      <div class='line'>Smooth was his speech, and show’d a gentle mind,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Deaf to his praise, and to his merits blind,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But raised by woman’s smile, and pleased with all mankind.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>At humble distance he this fair survey’d,      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Read her high temper, yet adored the Maid;</div>
      <div class='line'>Far off he gazed, as if afraid to meet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or show the hope her anger would defeat.</div>
      <div class='line'>Awful his love, and kept a guarded way,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Afraid to venture, till it finds it may.</div>
      <div class='line'>And soon it found! nor could the Lady’s pride</div>
      <div class='line'>Her triumph bury, or her pleasure hide.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And jealous Love, that ever looks to spy</div>
      <div class='line'>The dreaded wandering of a lady’s eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perceived with anguish, that the prize long sought      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A sudden rival from his hopes had caught.</div>
      <div class='line'>Still Villars loved; at length, in strong despair,</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er-tortured passion thus preferr’d its prayer:—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Life of my life! at once my fate decree—</div>
      <div class='line'>I wait my death, or more than life, from thee.</div>
      <div class='line'>I have no arts, nor powers, thy soul to move,</div>
      <div class='line'>But doting constancy, and boundless love;</div>
      <div class='line'>This is my all: had I the world to give,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thine were its throne—now bid me die or live!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Or die or live”—the gentle Lady cried—      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“As suits thee best; that point thyself decide!</div>
      <div class='line'>But, if to death thou hast thyself decreed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then like a man perform the manly deed;</div>
      <div class='line'>The well-charged pistol to the ear apply,</div>
      <div class='line'>Make loud report, and like a hero die!</div>
      <div class='line'>Let rogues and rats on ropes and poison seize—</div>
      <div class='line'>Shame not thy friends by petty death like these;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sure we must grieve at what thou think’st to do,</div>
      <div class='line'>But spare us blushes for the manner too!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then with inviting smiles she turn’d aside,      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Allay’d his anger, and consoled his pride.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oft had the fickle fair beheld with scorn</div>
      <div class='line'>The unhappy man bewilder’d and forlorn;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then with one softening glance of those bright eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Restored his spirit, and dispersed his sighs.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft had I seen him on the lea below,</div>
      <div class='line'>As feelings moved him, walking quick or slow:</div>
      <div class='line'>Now a glad thought, and now a doleful came,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he adored or cursed the changeful dame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who was to him as cause is to effect—      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Poor tool of pride, perverseness, and neglect!</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon thy rival were her thoughts bestow’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ambitious love within her bosom glow’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>And oft she wish’d, and strong was her desire,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>The Lord could love her like the faithful Squire.</div>
      <div class='line'>But she was rivall’d in that noble breast—</div>
      <div class='line'>He loved her passing well, but not the best;</div>
      <div class='line'>For self reign’d there; but still he call’d her fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And woo’d the Muse, his passion to declare.</div>
      <div class='line'>His verses all were flaming, all were fine,      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With sweetness, nay with sense, in every line—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not as Lord Byron would have done the thing,</div>
      <div class='line'>But better far than lords are used to sing.</div>
      <div class='line'>It pleased the Maid, and she, in very truth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Loved, in Calista’s love, the noble youth;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not, like sweet Juliet, with that pure delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fond and yet chaste, enraptur’d and yet right;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not like the tender Imogen, confined</div>
      <div class='line'>To one, but one! the true, the wedded mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>True, one preferr’d our sighing nymph as these,      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But thought not, like them, one alone could please.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Time pass’d, nor yet the youthful peer proposed</div>
      <div class='line'>To end his suit, nor his had Villars closed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fond hints the one, the other cruel, bore;</div>
      <div class='line'>That was more cautious, this was kind the more:</div>
      <div class='line'>Both for soft moments waited—that, to take</div>
      <div class='line'>Of these advantage; fairly, this, to make.</div>
      <div class='line'>These moments came—or so my Lord believed—</div>
      <div class='line'>He dropp’d his mask; and both were undeceived.</div>
      <div class='line'>She saw the vice that would no longer feign,      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And he an angry beauty’s pure disdain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Villars that night had in my ear confess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>He thought himself her spaniel and her jest.</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw his rival of his goddess sure;</div>
      <div class='line'>“But then,” he cried, “her virtue is secure.</div>
      <div class='line'>Should he offend, I haply may obtain</div>
      <div class='line'>The high reward of vigilance and pain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till then I take, and on my bended knee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Scraps from the banquet, gleanings of the tree.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Pitying, I smiled; for I had known the time      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of Love insulted—constancy my crime.</div>
      <div class='line'>Not thus our friend: for him the morning shone</div>
      <div class='line'>In tenfold glory, as for him alone;</div>
      <div class='line'>He wept, expecting still reproof to meet,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>And all that was not cruel count as sweet.</div>
      <div class='line'>Back he return’d, all eagerness and joy;</div>
      <div class='line'>Proud as a prince, and restless as a boy.</div>
      <div class='line'>He sought to speak, but could not aptly find</div>
      <div class='line'>Words for his use, they enter’d not his mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>So full of bliss, that wonder and delight      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Seem’d in those happy moments to unite.</div>
      <div class='line'>He was like one who gains, but dreads to lose,</div>
      <div class='line'>A prize that seems to vanish as he views;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in his look was wildness and alarm—</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a sad conjuror, who forgets his charm</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when the demon at the call appears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cannot command the spirit for his fears:</div>
      <div class='line'>So Villars seem’d by his own bliss perplex’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And scarcely knowing what would happen next.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But soon, a witness to their vows, I saw      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The maiden his, if not by love, by law;</div>
      <div class='line'>The bells proclaim’d it—merry call’d by those</div>
      <div class='line'>Who have no foresight of their neighbours’ woes.</div>
      <div class='line'>How proudly show’d the man his lovely bride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Demurely pacing, pondering, at his side!</div>
      <div class='line'>While all the loving maids around declared,</div>
      <div class='line'>That faith and constancy deserved reward!</div>
      <div class='line'>The baffled Lord retreated from the scene</div>
      <div class='line'>Of so much gladness, with a world of spleen;</div>
      <div class='line'>And left the wedded couple, to protest,      <span class='linenum'>210}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That he no fear, that she no love, possess’d;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That all his vows were scorn’d, and all his hope a jest.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then fell the oaks, to let in light of day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then rose the mansion that we now survey;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then all the world flock’d gaily to the scene</div>
      <div class='line'>Of so much splendour, and its splendid queen.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, whether all within the gentle breast</div>
      <div class='line'>Of him, of her, was happy or at rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether no lonely sigh confess’d regret—</div>
      <div class='line'>Was then unknown, and is a secret yet;      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And we may think, in common duty bound,</div>
      <div class='line'>That no complaint is made where none is found.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then came the Rival to his villa down,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lost to the pleasures of the heartless town;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Famous he grew, and he invited all</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom he had known to banquet at the Hall;</div>
      <div class='line'>Talk’d of his love, and said, with many a sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis death to lose her, and I wish to die.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Twice met the parties; but with cool disdain</div>
      <div class='line'>In her, in him with looks of awe and pain.      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Villars had pity, and conceived it hard</div>
      <div class='line'>That true regret should meet with no regard—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Smile, my Matilda! virtue should inflict</div>
      <div class='line'>No needless pain, nor be so sternly strict.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Hall was furnish’d in superior style,</div>
      <div class='line'>And money wanted from our sister isle;</div>
      <div class='line'>The lady-mother to the husband sued—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Alas! that care should on our bliss intrude!</div>
      <div class='line'>You must to Ireland; our possessions there</div>
      <div class='line'>Require your presence, nay, demand your care.      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>My pensive daughter begs with you to sail;</div>
      <div class='line'>But spare your wife, nor let the wish prevail!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He went, and found upon his Irish land</div>
      <div class='line'>Cases and griefs he could not understand.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some glimmering light at first his prospect cheer’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>Clear it was not, but would in time be clear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, when his lawyers had their efforts made,</div>
      <div class='line'>No mind in man the darkness could pervade;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas palpably obscure: week after week</div>
      <div class='line'>He sought for comfort, but was still to seek.      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At length, impatient to return, he strove</div>
      <div class='line'>No more with law, but gave the rein to love;</div>
      <div class='line'>And to his Lady and their native shore</div>
      <div class='line'>Vow’d to return, and thence to turn no more.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>While yet on Irish ground in trouble kept,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Husband’s terrors in his toils had slept;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he no sooner touch’d the British soil,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than jealous terrors took the place of toil—</div>
      <div class='line'>Where has she been? and how attended? Who</div>
      <div class='line'>Has watch’d her conduct, and will vouch her true?      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She sigh’d at parting; but methought her sighs</div>
      <div class='line'>Were more profound than would from nature rise;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, though she wept as never wife before,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet were her eyelids neither swell’d nor sore.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Her lady-mother has a good repute</div>
      <div class='line'>As watchful dragon of forbidden fruit;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet dragons sleep, and mothers have been known</div>
      <div class='line'>To guard a daughter’s secret as their own;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor can the absent in their travel see</div>
      <div class='line'>How a fond wife and mother may agree.      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Suppose the lady is most virtuous!—then,</div>

      <div class='line'>Of all they plan she neither thinks nor cares,</div>
      <div class='line'>But keeps, good lady! at her books and prayers.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“In all her letters there are love, respect,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'>Too much—she fears that I should see neglect;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And there are fond expressions, but unlike</div>
      <div class='line'>The rest, as meant to be observed and strike;</div>

      <div class='line'>And come not freely from the gentle heart—</div>
      <div class='line'>Adopted words, and brought from memory’s store,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the chill faltering heart supplies no more:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis so the hypocrite pretends to feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>And speaks the words of earnestness and zeal,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Hers was a sudden, though a sweet consent;</div>
      <div class='line'>May she not now as suddenly repent?</div>
      <div class='line'>My rival’s vices drove him from her door;</div>

      <div class='line'>That all her scorn and anger would remain?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Oh, words of folly!—is it thus I deem</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the chaste object of my fond esteem?</div>
      <div class='line'>Away with doubt! to jealousy adieu!</div>
      <div class='line'>I know her fondness, and believe her true.—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Yet why that haste to furnish every need,</div>
      <div class='line'>And send me forth with comfort, and with speed?</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes; for she dreaded that the winter’s rage</div>
      <div class='line'>And our frail hoy should on the seas engage.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But that vile girl! I saw a treacherous eye      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line in2'>Such, as he told me, were the doubt, the dread,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>By jealous fears on observations fed.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Home he proceeded: there remain’d to him</div>
      <div class='line'>But a few miles—the night was wet and dim;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thick, heavy dews descended on the ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all was sad and melancholy round.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>While thinking thus, an inn’s far gleaming fire      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Caused new emotions in the pensive Squire:</div>
      <div class='line'>Here I may learn, and seeming careless too,</div>
      <div class='line'>If all is well, ere I my way pursue.—</div>
      <div class='line'>How fare you, landlord?—how, my friend, are all—</div>
      <div class='line'>Have you not seen—my people at the Hall?</div>
      <div class='line'>Well, I may judge?——”</div>
      <div class='line in18'>“Oh! yes, your Honour, well,</div>
      <div class='line'>As Joseph knows; and he was sent to tell.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“How? sent?—I miss’d him—Joseph, do you say?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why sent, if well?—I miss’d him on the way.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There was a poacher on the chimney-seat,      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A gipsy, conjuror, smuggler, stroller, cheat.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Squire had fined him for a captured hare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whipp’d and imprison’d—he had felt the fare,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he remember’d: “Will your Honour know</div>
      <div class='line'>How does my Lady? that myself can show.</div>
      <div class='line'>On Monday early—for your Honour sees</div>
      <div class='line'>The poor man must not slumber at his ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor must he into woods and coverts lurk,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor work alone, but must be seen to work:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis not, your Honour knows, sufficient now      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For us to live, but we must prove it—how.</div>
      <div class='line'>Stay, please your Honour—I was early up,</div>
      <div class='line'>And forth without a morsel or a sup.</div>
      <div class='line'>There was my Lady’s carriage—Whew! it drove</div>
      <div class='line'>As if the horses had been spurr’d by Love.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“A poet, John!” said Villars—feebly said,</div>
      <div class='line'>Confused with fear, and humbled and dismay’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>“And where this carriage?—but, my heart! enough—</div>
      <div class='line'>Why do I listen to the villain’s stuff?—</div>
      <div class='line'>And where wert thou? and what the spur of thine      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That led thee forth?—we surely may divine!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Hunger, your Honour! I and my poor wife</div>
      <div class='line'>Have now no other in our wane of life.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Were Phœbe handsome, and were I a Squire,</div>
      <div class='line'>I might suspect her, and young Lords admire.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>What, rascal!——”—“Nay, your Honour, on my word,</div>
      <div class='line'>I should be jealous of that fine young Lord;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet him my Lady in the carriage took,</div>
      <div class='line'>But innocent—I’d swear it on the book.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“You villain, swear!”—for still he wish’d to stay,      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And hear what more the fellow had to say.—</div>
      <div class='line'>“‘Phœbe,’ said I, ‘a rogue that had a heart</div>
      <div class='line'>To do the deed would make his Honour smart.’—</div>
      <div class='line'>Says Phœbe, wisely, ‘Think you, would he go,</div>
      <div class='line'>If he were jealous, from my Lady?—No.’”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This was too much! poor Villars left the inn,</div>
      <div class='line'>To end the grief that did but then begin.</div>
      <div class='line'>“With my Matilda in the coach!—what lies</div>
      <div class='line'>Will the vile rascal in his spleen devise?</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet this is true, that on some vile pretence      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Men may entrap the purest innocence.</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw my fears—alas! I am not free</div>
      <div class='line'>From every doubt—but, no! it cannot be!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Villars moved slow, moved quick, as check’d by fear</div>
      <div class='line'>Or urged by Love, and drew his mansion near.</div>
      <div class='line'>Light burst upon him, yet he fancied gloom,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor came a twinkling from Matilda’s room.—</div>
      <div class='line'>What then? ’tis idle to expect that all</div>
      <div class='line'>Should be produced at jealous fancy’s call;</div>
      <div class='line'>How! the park-gate wide open! who would dare      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Do this, if her presiding glance were there?</div>
      <div class='line'>But yet, by chance—I know not what to think,</div>
      <div class='line'>For thought is hell, and I’m upon the brink!</div>
      <div class='line'>Not for a thousand worlds, ten thousand lives,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would I——Oh! what depends upon our wives!</div>
      <div class='line'>Pains, labours, terrors, all would I endure,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes, all but this—and this, could I be sure——”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Just then a light within the window shone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And show’d a lady, weeping and alone.</div>
      <div class='line'>His heart beat fondly—on another view,      <span class='linenum'>380&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It beat more strongly, and in terror too—</div>
      <div class='line'>It was his Sister!—and there now appear’d</div>
      <div class='line'>A servant, creeping like a man that fear’d.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>He spoke with terror—“Sir, did Joseph tell?</div>
      <div class='line'>Have you not met him?”—</div>
      <div class='line in24'>“Is your Lady well?”</div>
      <div class='line'>Well? Sir—your Honour——”</div>
      <div class='line in24'>“Heaven and earth! what mean</div>
      <div class='line'>Your stupid questions? I have nothing seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor heard, nor know, nor—Do, good Thomas, speak!</div>
      <div class='line'>Your mistress——”</div>
      <div class='line in14'>“Sir, has gone from home a week—</div>
      <div class='line'>My Lady, Sir, your sister”—— But, too late      <span class='linenum'>390&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Was this—my Friend had yielded to his fate.</div>
      <div class='line'>He heard the truth, became serene and mild,</div>
      <div class='line'>Patient and still, as a corrected child;</div>
      <div class='line'>At once his spirit with his fortune fell</div>
      <div class='line'>To the last ebb, and whisper’d—‘It is well.’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such was his fall; and grievous the effect!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>From henceforth all things fell into neglect—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The mind no more alert, the form no more erect.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Villars long since, as he indulged his spleen</div>
      <div class='line'>By lonely travel on the coast, had seen      <span class='linenum'>400&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A large old mansion suffer’d to decay</div>
      <div class='line'>In some law-strife, and slowly drop away.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dark elms around the constant herons bred;</div>
      <div class='line'>Those the marsh dykes, the neighbouring ocean, fed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rocks near the coast no shipping would allow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And stubborn heath around forbad the plough;</div>
      <div class='line'>Dull must the scene have been in years of old,</div>
      <div class='line'>But now was wildly dismal to behold—</div>
      <div class='line'>One level sadness! marsh, and heath, and sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, save these high dark elms, nor plant nor tree.      <span class='linenum'>410&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>In this bleak ruin Villars found a room,</div>
      <div class='line'>Square, small, and lofty—seat of grief and gloom.</div>
      <div class='line'>A sloping skylight on the white wall threw,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the sun set, a melancholy hue;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Hall of Vathek has a room so bare,</div>
      <div class='line'>So small, so sad, so form’d to nourish care.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Here,” said the Traveller, “all so dark within,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dull without, a man might mourn for sin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or punish sinners—here a wanton wife</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>And vengeful husband might be cursed for life.”      <span class='linenum'>420&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>His mind was now in just that wretched state</div>
      <div class='line'>That deems Revenge our right, and crime our fate.</div>
      <div class='line'>All other views he banish’d from his soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>And let this tyrant vex him and control;</div>
      <div class='line'>Life he despised, and had that Lord defied,</div>
      <div class='line'>But that he long’d for Vengeance e’er he died.</div>
      <div class='line'>The law he spurn’d, the combat he declined,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to his purpose all his soul resign’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Full fifteen months had pass’d, and we began</div>
      <div class='line'>To have some hope of the returning man;      <span class='linenum'>430&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Now to his steward of his small affairs</div>
      <div class='line'>He wrote, and mention’d leases and repairs;</div>
      <div class='line'>But yet his soul was on its scheme intent,</div>
      <div class='line'>And but a moment to his interest lent.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His faithless wife and her triumphant peer</div>
      <div class='line'>Despised his vengeance, and disdained to fear;</div>
      <div class='line'>In splendid lodgings near the town they dwelt,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor fears from wrath, nor threats from conscience, felt.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Long time our friend had watch’d, and much had paid</div>
      <div class='line'>For vulgar minds, who lent his vengeance aid.      <span class='linenum'>440&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At length one evening, late returning home,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thoughtless and fearless of the ills to come,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Wife was seized, when void of all alarm</div>
      <div class='line'>And vainly trusting to a footman’s arm.</div>
      <div class='line'>Death in his hand, the Husband stood in view,</div>
      <div class='line'>Commanding silence, and obedience too;</div>
      <div class='line'>Forced to his carriage, sinking at his side,</div>
      <div class='line'>Madly he drove her—Vengeance was his guide.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>All in that ruin Villars had prepared,</div>
      <div class='line'>And meant her fate and sorrow to have shared;      <span class='linenum'>450&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There he design’d they should for ever dwell,</div>
      <div class='line'>The weeping pair of a monastic cell.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>An ancient couple from their cottage went,</div>
      <div class='line'>Won by his pay, to this imprisonment;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all was order’d in his mind—the pain</div>
      <div class='line'>He must inflict, the shame she must sustain;</div>
      <div class='line'>But such his gentle spirit, such his love,</div>
      <div class='line'>The proof might fail of all he meant to prove.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Features so dear had still maintain’d their sway,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>And looks so loved had taught him to obey;      <span class='linenum'>460&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Rage and Revenge had yielded to the sight</div>
      <div class='line'>Of charms that waken wonder and delight;</div>
      <div class='line'>The harsher passions from the heart had flown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And <span class='sc'>Love</span> regain’d his Subject and his Throne.</div>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE FAREWELL AND RETURN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c025'>[The next Tale, and a number of others, were originally designed for
a separate volume, to be entitled “The Farewell and Return.” In a letter
to Mrs. Leadbetter, written in 1823, the poet says—“In my ‘Farewell
and Return’ I suppose a young man to take leave of his native place, and
to exchange <i>farewells</i> with his friends and acquaintance there—in short,
with as many characters as I have fancied I could manage. These, and
their several situations and prospects, being briefly sketched, an interval is
supposed to elapse; and our youth, a youth no more, <i>returns</i> to the scene
of his early days. Twenty years have passed; and the interest, if there be
any, consists in the completion, more or less unexpected, of the history of
each person to whom he had originally bidden farewell.”</p>

<p class='c026'>The reader will find the Tales written on this plan divided each into
two or more sections, and will easily perceive where the <i>farewell</i> terminates
and the <i>return</i> begins.]</p>

      <div class='line in2'>Yes!—twenty years have pass’d, and I am come,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unknown, unwelcomed, to my early home;</div>
      <div class='line'>A stranger, striving in my walks to trace</div>
      <div class='line'>The youthful features in some aged face.</div>
      <div class='line'>On as I move, some curious looks I read;</div>
      <div class='line'>We pause a moment, doubt, and then proceed.</div>
      <div class='line'>They’re like what once I saw, but not the same;</div>
      <div class='line'>I lose the air, the features, and the name.      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet something seems like knowledge, but the change</div>
      <div class='line'>Confuses me, and all in him is strange.</div>
      <div class='line'>That bronzed old Sailor, with his wig awry—</div>
      <div class='line'>Sure he will know me! No, he passes by.</div>
      <div class='line'>They seem like me in doubt; but they can call</div>
      <div class='line'>Their friends around them—I am lost to all.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The very place is alter’d. What I left</div>
      <div class='line'>Seems of its space and dignity bereft:</div>
      <div class='line'>The streets are narrow, and the buildings mean;</div>
      <div class='line'>Did I, or Fancy, leave them broad and clean?      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The ancient church, in which I felt a pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>As struck by magic, is but half as wide;</div>
      <div class='line'>The tower is shorter, the sonorous bell</div>
      <div class='line'>Tells not the hour as it was wont to tell;</div>
      <div class='line'>The market dwindles, every shop and stall</div>
      <div class='line'>Sinks in my view; there’s littleness in all.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mine is the error; prepossess’d I see;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the change I mourn is change in me.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One object only is the same; the sight</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the wide Ocean by the moon’s pale light,      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With her long ray of glory, that we mark</div>
      <div class='line'>On the wild waves when all beside is dark.</div>
      <div class='line'>This is the work of Nature, and the eye</div>
      <div class='line'>In vain the boundless prospect would descry:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>What mocks our view cannot contracted be;</div>
      <div class='line'>We cannot lessen what we cannot see.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Would I could now a single Friend behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who would the yet mysterious facts unfold,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Time yet spares, and to a stranger show</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ events he wishes, and yet fears to know!      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Much by myself I might in listening glean,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mix’d with the crowd, unmark’d if not unseen;</div>
      <div class='line'>Uninterrupted, I might ramble on,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor cause an interest, nor a thought, in one.</div>
      <div class='line'>For who looks backward to a being tost</div>
      <div class='line'>About the world, forgotten long, and lost;</div>
      <div class='line'>For whom, departing, not a tear was shed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who disappear’d, was missing, and was dead—</div>
      <div class='line'>Save that he left no grave, where some might pass,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ask each other who that being was!      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>I, as a ghost invisible, can stray</div>
      <div class='line'>Among the crowd, and cannot lose my way;</div>
      <div class='line'>My ways are where the voice of man is known,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though no occasion offers for my own;</div>
      <div class='line'>My eager mind to fill with food I seek,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, like the ghost, await for one to speak.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>See I not One whom I before have seen?</div>
      <div class='line'>That face, though now untroubled and serene,</div>
      <div class='line'>That air, though steady now, that look, though tame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pertain to one, whom, though I doubt to name,      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet was he not a dashing youth and wild,</div>
      <div class='line'>Proud as a man, and haughty when a child?</div>
      <div class='line'>Talents were his; he was in nature kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>With lofty, strong, and independent mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>His father wealthy, but, in very truth,</div>
      <div class='line'>He was a rash, untamed, expensive youth;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as I now remember the report,</div>
      <div class='line'>Told how his father’s money he would sport.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet in his dress and manner now appears</div>
      <div class='line'>No sign of faults that stain’d his earlier years;      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Mildness there seems, and marks of sober sense,</div>
      <div class='line'>That bear no token of that wild expense</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as to ruin leads!—I may mistake,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet may, perchance, a useful friendship make.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>He looks as one whom I should not offend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Address’d as him whom I would make a friend.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Men with respect attend him.—He proceeds</div>
      <div class='line'>To yonder public room—why, then he reads!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Suppose me right—a mighty change is wrought;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Time ere now has care and caution taught.      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>May I address him? And yet, why afraid?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Deny he may, but he will not upbraid;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor must I lose him, for I want his aid.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Propitious fate! beyond my hope I find      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A being well-inform’d, and much inclined      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To solve my many doubts, and ease my anxious mind.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now shall we meet, and he will give reply</div>
      <div class='line'>To all I ask!—How full of fears am I;</div>
      <div class='line'>Poor, nervous, trembling! what have I to fear?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Have I a wife, a child, one creature here,      <span class='linenum'>150}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Whose health would bring me joy, whose death would claim a tear?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>This is the time appointed, this the place:</div>
      <div class='line'>Now shall I learn, how some have run their race</div>
      <div class='line'>With honour, some with shame; and I shall know</div>
      <div class='line'>How man behaves in Fortune’s ebb and flow;—</div>
      <div class='line'>What wealth or want, what trouble, sorrow, joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have been allotted to the [girl] and boy</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom I left laughing at the ills of life—</div>
      <div class='line'>Now the grave father, or the awful wife.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then shall I hear, how tried the wise and good!      <span class='linenum'>160}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>How fall’n the house that once in honour stood!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And moving accidents, from war and fire and flood!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>These shall I hear, if to his promise true;</div>
      <div class='line'>His word is pledged to tell me all he knew</div>
      <div class='line'>Of living men; and memory then will trace</div>
      <div class='line'>Those who no more with living men have place,</div>
      <div class='line'>As they were borne to their last quiet homes—</div>
      <div class='line'>This shall I learn!—And lo! my Teacher comes.</div>

      <div class='line'>To all that turns to money—he must thrive.</div>
      <div class='line'>Obsequious, civil, loath t’ offend or trust,</div>
      <div class='line'>And full of awe for greatness—thrive he must:      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For well he knows to creep; and he in time,</div>
      <div class='line'>By wealth assisted, will aspire to climb.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Pains-taking lad he was, and with his slate</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>For hours in useful meditation sate;</div>
      <div class='line'>Puzzled, and seizing every boy at hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>To make him—hard the labour!—understand.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, when of learning he enough possess’d</div>
      <div class='line'>For his affairs, who would might learn the rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>All else was useless, when he had obtain’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Knowledge that told him what he lost or gain’d.      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He envied no man for his learning: he</div>
      <div class='line'>Who was not rich, was poor with <span class='sc'>Barnaby</span>;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he for envy has no thought to spare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor love nor hate—his heart is in his ware.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Happy the man whose greatest pleasure lies</div>
      <div class='line'>In the fair trade by which he hopes to rise!</div>
      <div class='line'>To him how bright the opening day, how blest</div>
      <div class='line'>The busy noon, how sweet the evening rest!</div>
      <div class='line'>To him the nation’s state is all unknown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose watchful eye is ever on his own.      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>You talk of patriots, men who give up all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yea, life itself, at their dear country’s call:</div>
      <div class='line'>He look’d on such as men of other date—</div>
      <div class='line'>Men to admire, and not to imitate;</div>
      <div class='line'>They as his Bible-Saints to him appear’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>Lost to the world, but still to be revered.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet there’s a Widow, in a neighbouring street,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom he contrives in Sunday-dress to meet;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her’s house and land; and these are more delight</div>
      <div class='line'>To him than learning, in the proverb’s spite.      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Widow sees at once the Trader’s views,</div>
      <div class='line'>And means to soothe him, flatter, and refuse.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet there are moments when a woman fails</div>
      <div class='line'>In such design, and so the man prevails.</div>
      <div class='line'>Love she has not; but, in a guardless hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>May lose her purpose, and resign her power;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet all such hazard she resolves to run,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleased to be woo’d, and fearless to be won.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Lovers like these, as dresses thrown aside,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are kept and shown to feed a woman’s pride:      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Old-fashion’d, ugly, call them what she will,</div>
      <div class='line'>They serve as signs of her importance still.</div>
      <div class='line'>She thinks they might inferior forms adorn</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>And does not love to hear them used with scorn;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till, on some day when she has need of dress,</div>
      <div class='line'>And none at hand to serve her in distress,</div>
      <div class='line'>She takes th’ insulted robe, and turns about;</div>
      <div class='line'>Long-hidden beauties one by one peer out.</div>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis not so bad! see, Jenny—I declare,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis pretty well, and then ’tis lasting wear;      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And what is fashion?—if a woman’s wise,</div>
      <div class='line'>She will the substance, not the shadow, prize;</div>

      <div class='line'>Off go these ugly trappings every one.”</div>
      <div class='line'>The dress is worn; a friendly smile is raised,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the good lady for her courage praised—</div>
      <div class='line'>Till wonder dies.—The dress is worn with pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>And not one trapping yet is cast aside.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Meanwhile the man his six-day toil renews;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Her age I knew not, but it seem’d the age</div>
      <div class='line'>When Love is wont a serious war to wage</div>

      <div class='line'>This was by most unquestioned, and the few</div>

      <div class='line'>The kind of friendship women have with men:      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At length t’was love, but candid, open, fair,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>In their discourse religion had its place,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he of doctrines talk’d, and she of grace:</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew the different sects, the varying creeds,</div>
      <div class='line'>While she, less learned, spake of virtuous deeds;</div>
      <div class='line'>He dwelt on errors into which we fall,</div>
      <div class='line'>She on the gracious remedy for all;</div>
      <div class='line'>So between both, his knowledge and her own,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was the whole Christian to perfection shown.      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Though neither quite approved the other’s part—</div>

      <div class='line'>Still to each other they were dear, were good,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all these matters kindly understood;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Her prudent lover to her man of law      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Show’d how he lived: it seem’d without a flaw;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She saw their moderate means—content with what she saw.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Jane had no doubts—with so much to admire,      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She judged it insult farther to inquire.</div>
      <div class='line'>The lover sought—what lover brooks delay?—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For full assent, and for an early day—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And he would construe well the soft consenting Nay!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The day was near, and Jane, with book in hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sat down to read—perhaps might understand;</div>
      <div class='line'>For what prevented?—say, she seem’d to read;</div>
      <div class='line'>When one there came, her own sad cause to plead;</div>
      <div class='line'>A stranger she, who fearless named that cause,</div>

      <div class='line'>’Tis not to claim him, ’tis not to reclaim—</div>
      <div class='line'>But ’tis that he may for my wrongs be paid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And feel the vengeance of the wretch he made.      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>Not so our maiden. She, before resign’d,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Had now the anguish of a wounded mind—      <span class='linenum'>160}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And felt the languid grief that the deserted find.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>On him she had reposed each worldly view,</div>
      <div class='line'>And when he fail’d, the world itself withdrew,</div>
      <div class='line'>With all its prospects. Nothing could restore</div>
      <div class='line'>To life its value; hope would live no more:</div>
      <div class='line'>Pensive by nature, she can not sustain</div>
      <div class='line'>The sneer of pity that the heartless feign;</div>
      <div class='line'>But to the pressure of her griefs gives way,</div>
      <div class='line'>A quiet victim, and a patient prey;</div>

      <div class='line'>And other hope must from the future rise.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She still extends to grief and want her aid,</div>

      <div class='line'>Death is her soul’s relief; to him she flies</div>
      <div class='line'>For consolation that this world denies.</div>
      <div class='line'>No more to life’s false promises she clings,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She longs to change this troubled state of things,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>T</span>o part is painful; nay, to bid adieu</div>
      <div class='line'>Ev’n to a favourite spot is painful too.</div>
      <div class='line'>That fine old Seat, with all those oaks around,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Oft have I view’d with reverence so profound,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As something sacred dwelt in that delicious ground.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>There, with its tenantry about, reside</div>
      <div class='line'>A genuine English race, the country’s pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now a Lady, last of all that race,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is the departing spirit of the place.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hers is the last of all that noble blood,      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That flow’d through generations brave and good;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if there dwells a native pride in her,</div>
      <div class='line'>It is the pride of name and character.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>True, she will speak, in her abundant zeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of stainless honour; that she needs must feel;</div>
      <div class='line'>She must lament, that she is now the last</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all who gave such splendour to the past.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Still are her habits of the ancient kind;</div>
      <div class='line'>She knows the poor, the sick, the lame, the blind.</div>
      <div class='line'>She holds, so she believes, her wealth in trust;      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And being kind, with her, is being just.</div>
      <div class='line'>Though soul and body she delights to aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet of her skill she’s prudently afraid;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>So to her chaplain’s care she <i>this</i> commends,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when <i>that</i> craves, the village doctor sends.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At church attendance she requires of all</div>
      <div class='line'>Who would be held in credit at the Hall;</div>
      <div class='line'>A due respect to each degree she shows,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pays the debt that every mortal owes;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis by opinion that respect is led:      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The rich esteem because the poor are fed.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her servants all, if so we may describe</div>
      <div class='line'>That ancient, grave, observant, decent tribe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who with her share the blessings of the Hall,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are kind but grave, are proud but courteous all—</div>
      <div class='line'>Proud of their lucky lot! behold, how stands</div>
      <div class='line'>That grey-haired butler, waiting her commands;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lady dines, and every day he feels</div>
      <div class='line'>That his good mistress falters in her meals.</div>
      <div class='line'>With what respectful manners he entreats      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That she would eat—yet Jacob little eats;</div>
      <div class='line'>When she forbears, his supplicating eye</div>
      <div class='line'>Intreats the noble dame once more to try.</div>
      <div class='line'>Their years the same; and he has never known</div>
      <div class='line'>Another place; and this he deems his own—</div>
      <div class='line'>All appertains to him. Whate’er he sees</div>
      <div class='line'>Is <i>ours</i>!—“our house, our land, our walks, our trees!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But still he fears the time is just at hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he no more shall in that presence stand;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he resolves with mingled grief and pride,      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To serve no being in the world beside.</div>
      <div class='line'>“He has enough,” he says, with many a sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>“For him to serve his God, and learn to die:</div>
      <div class='line'>He and his lady shall have heard their call,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the new folk, the strangers, may have all.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But, leaving these to their accustom’d way,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Seat itself demands a short delay.</div>
      <div class='line'>We all have interest there—the trees that grow      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Near to that seat, to that their grandeur owe;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They take, but largely pay, and equal grace bestow.      <span class='linenum'>60}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They hide a part, but still, the part they shade</div>
      <div class='line'>Is more inviting to our fancy made;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if the eye be robb’d of half its sight,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Th’ imagination feels the more delight.</div>
      <div class='line'>These giant oaks by no man’s order stand;</div>
      <div class='line'>Heaven did the work, by no man was it plann’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Here I behold no puny works of art;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>None give me reasons why these views impart      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Such charm to fill the mind, such joy to swell the heart.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>These very pinnacles, and turrets small,      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And windows dim, have beauty in them all.</div>
      <div class='line'>How stately stand yon pines upon the hill;</div>
      <div class='line'>How soft the murmurs of that living rill;</div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er the park’s tall paling, scarcely higher,</div>
      <div class='line'>Peeps the low Church and shows the modest spire.</div>
      <div class='line'>Unnumber’d violets on those banks appear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the first-born beauties of the year;</div>
      <div class='line'>The grey-green blossoms of the willows bring</div>
      <div class='line'>The large wild bees upon the labouring wing.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then comes the Summer with augmented pride,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Whose pure small streams along the valleys glide;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her richer Flora their brief charms display,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as the fruit advances, fall away.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then shall th’ autumnal yellow clothe the leaf,</div>
      <div class='line'>What time the reaper binds the burden’d sheaf;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then silent groves denote the dying year,</div>
      <div class='line'>The morning frost, and noon-tide gossamer;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all be silent in the scene around—</div>
      <div class='line'>All, save the distant sea’s uncertain sound,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or here and there the gun, whose loud report      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Proclaims to man that Death is but his sport.</div>
      <div class='line'>And then the wintry winds begin to blow;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then fall the flaky stars of gathering snow;</div>
      <div class='line'>When on the thorn the ripening sloe, yet blue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Takes the bright varnish of the morning dew;</div>
      <div class='line'>The aged moss grows brittle on the pale;</div>
      <div class='line'>The dry boughs splinter in the windy gale;</div>
      <div class='line'>And every changing season of the year</div>
      <div class='line'>Stamps on the scene its English character.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Farewell! a prouder Mansion I may see,      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But much must meet in that which equals thee!</div>

      <div class='line in2'>I leave the town, and take a well-known way</div>
      <div class='line'>To that old Mansion in the closing day,</div>
      <div class='line'>When beams of golden light are shed around,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sweet is every night and every sound.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pass but this hill, and I shall then behold</div>
      <div class='line'>The Seat so honour’d, no admired of old,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet admired——</div>
      <div class='line in20'>Alas! I see a change,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of odious kind, and lamentably strange.</div>
      <div class='line'>Who had done this? The good old Lady lies      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Within her tomb; but, who could this advise?</div>
      <div class='line'>What barbarous hand could all this mischief do,</div>

      <div class='line'>Who had done this? Some genuine Son of Trade</div>
      <div class='line'>Has all this dreadful devastation made;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some man with line and rule, and evil eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who could no beauty in a tree descry,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save in a clump, when stationed by his hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And standing where his genius bade them stand;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some true admirer of the time’s reform,      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who strips an ancient dwelling like a storm;</div>
      <div class='line'>Strips it of all its dignity and grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>To put his own dear fancies in their place.</div>
      <div class='line'>He hates concealment: all that was enclosed</div>
      <div class='line'>By venerable wood is now exposed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a few stripling elms all oaks appear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fenced round by boards, to keep them from the deer.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I miss the grandeur of the rich old scene,</div>
      <div class='line'>And see not what these clumps and patches mean!</div>
      <div class='line'>This shrubby belt that runs the land around      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Shuts freedom out! what being likes a bound?</div>
      <div class='line'>The shrubs indeed, and ill-placed flowers, are gay,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And some would praise; I wish they were away,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That in the wild-wood maze I as of old might stray.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'>It is the rage of Taste—the rule and compass reign.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'>To say <i>farewell</i>, the lordly man would stare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would stretch his goodly form some inches higher,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then, without a single word, retire;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or from his state might haply condescend</div>
      <div class='line'>To doubt his memory—“Ha! your name, my friend?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He is the master of these things we see:</div>
      <div class='line'>Those vessels proudly riding by the quay;</div>
      <div class='line'>With all those mountain heaps of coal that lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>For half a county’s wonder and supply.      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Boats, cables, anchors, all to him pertain—</div>
      <div class='line'>A swimming fortune, all his father’s gain.</div>
      <div class='line'>He was a porter on the quay, and one</div>
      <div class='line'>Proud of his fortune, prouder of his son—</div>
      <div class='line'>Who was ashamed of him, and much distress’d</div>
      <div class='line'>To see his father was no better dress’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet for this parent did the son erect</div>
      <div class='line'>A tomb—’tis whisper’d, he must not expect</div>
      <div class='line'>The like for him, when he shall near it sleep—</div>
      <div class='line'>Where we behold the marble cherubs weep.      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>There are no merchants who with us reside</div>
      <div class='line'>In half his state—no wonder he has pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then he parades around that vast estate,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if he spurn’d the slaves that make him great;</div>
      <div class='line'>Speaking in tone so high, as if the ware</div>
      <div class='line'>Was nothing worth—at least not worth his care;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Yet should he not these bulky stores contemn,</div>
      <div class='line'>For all his glory he derives from them;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, were it not for that neglected store,</div>
      <div class='line'>This great rich man would be extremely poor.      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Generous men call him, for he deigns to give;</div>
      <div class='line'>He condescends to say the poor must live.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet in his seamen not a sign appears</div>
      <div class='line'>That they have much respect, or many fears;</div>
      <div class='line'>With inattention they their patron meet,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if they thought his dignity a cheat;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or of himself as, having much to do</div>
      <div class='line'>With their affairs, he very little knew;</div>
      <div class='line'>As if his ways to them so well were known</div>
      <div class='line'>That they might hear, and bow, and take their own.      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>He might contempt for men so humble feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>But this experience taught him to conceal;</div>
      <div class='line'>For sailors do not to a lord at land</div>
      <div class='line'>As to their captain in submission stand;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor have mere pomp and pride, of look or speech,</div>
      <div class='line'>Been able yet respect or awe to teach.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Guns, when with powder charged, will make a noise,</div>
      <div class='line'>To frighten babes, and be the sport of boys;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, when within men find there’s nothing more,</div>
      <div class='line'>They shout contemptuous at the idle roar.      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Thus will our lofty man to all appear,</div>
      <div class='line'>With nothing charged that they respect or fear.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His Lady, too, to her large purse applies,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all she fancies at the instant buys.</div>
      <div class='line'>How bows the market, when from stall to stall</div>
      <div class='line'>She walks, attended! how respectful all!</div>
      <div class='line'>To her free orders every maid attends,</div>
      <div class='line'>And strangers wonder what the woman spends.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There is an auction, and the people, shy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are loth to bid, and yet desire to buy.      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Jealous they gaze with mingled hope and fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of buying cheaply, and of paying dear.</div>
      <div class='line'>They see the hammer with determined air</div>
      <div class='line'>Seized for despatch, and bid in pure despair!</div>
      <div class='line'>They bid—the hand is quiet as before—</div>
      <div class='line'>Still stands old Puff till one advances more.—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Behold great madam, gliding through the crowd;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hear her too bid—decisive tone and loud!</div>
      <div class='line'>“Going! ’tis gone!” the hammer-holder cries—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Joy to you, Lady! you have gain’d a prize.”      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus comes and goes the wealth, that, saved or spent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Buys not a moment’s credit or content.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Farewell!</i> your fortune I forbear to guess;</div>

      <div class='line'>Nay, feeds himself! his failing is avow’d:</div>

      <div class='line'>Whom some in mirth or malice call a “<i>Blue</i>.”</div>
      <div class='line'>There needs no more—when that same word is said,</div>
      <div class='line'>The men grow shy, respectful, and afraid;</div>
      <div class='line'>Save the choice friends who in her colour dress,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all her praise in words like hers express.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Why should proud man in man that knowledge prize,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which he affects in woman to despise?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is he not envious when a lady gains,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In hours of leisure, and with little pains,      <span class='linenum'>10}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What he in many a year with painful toil obtains?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For surely knowledge should not odious grow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor ladies be despised for what they know;</div>
      <div class='line'>Truth, to no sex confined, her friends invites,</div>
      <div class='line'>And woman, long restrain’d, demands her rights.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor should a light and odious name be thrown</div>
      <div class='line'>On the fair dame who makes that knowledge known—</div>
      <div class='line'>Who bravely dares the world’s sarcastic sneer,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what she is, is willing to appear.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“And what she is not!” peevish man replies,      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His envy owning what his pride denies.</div>
      <div class='line'>But let him, envious as he is, repair</div>
      <div class='line'>To this sage Dame, and meet conviction there!</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span><span class='sc'>Miranda</span> sees her morning levee fill’d</div>
      <div class='line'>With men, in every art and science skill’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>Men who have gain’d a name, whom she invites,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because in men of genius she delights.</div>
      <div class='line'>To these she puts her questions, that produce</div>
      <div class='line'>Discussion vivid, and discourse abstruse;</div>
      <div class='line'>She no opinion for its boldness spares,      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But loves to show her audience what she dares;</div>
      <div class='line'>The creeds of all men she takes leave to sift,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, quite impartial, turns her own adrift.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her noble mind, with independent force,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her Rector questions on his late discourse;</div>
      <div class='line'>Perplex’d and pain’d, he wishes to retire</div>
      <div class='line'>From one whom critics, nay, whom crowds, admire—</div>
      <div class='line'>From her whose faith on no man’s dictate leans;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who her large creed from many a teacher gleans;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who for herself will judge, debate, decide,      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And be her own “philosopher and guide.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Why call a lady <i>Blue</i>? It is because</div>
      <div class='line'>She reads, converses, studies for applause;</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore all that she desires to know</div>
      <div class='line'>Is just as much as she can fairly show.</div>
      <div class='line'>The real knowledge we in secret hide;</div>
      <div class='line'>It is the counterfeit that makes our pride.</div>
      <div class='line'>“A little knowledge is a dangerous thing”—</div>
      <div class='line'>So sings the Poet, and so let him sing;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, if from little learning danger rose,      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I know not who in safety could repose.</div>
      <div class='line'>The evil rises from our own mistake,</div>
      <div class='line'>When we our ignorance for knowledge take;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or when the little that we have, through pride</div>
      <div class='line'>And vain poor self-love view’d, is magnified.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor is your deepest Azure always free</div>
      <div class='line'>From these same dangerous calls of vanity.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet of the sex are those who never show,</div>
      <div class='line'>By way of exhibition, what they know.</div>
      <div class='line'>Their books are read and praised, and so are they,      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But all without design, without display.</div>
      <div class='line'>Is there not One who reads the hearts of men,</div>
      <div class='line'>And paints them strongly with unrivall’d pen?</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>All their fierce Passions in her scenes appear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Terror she bids arise, bids fall the tear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Looks in the close recesses of the mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gives the finish’d portraits to mankind,</div>
      <div class='line'>By skill conducted, and to Nature true—</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet no man on earth would call <span class='sc'>Joanna</span> <i>Blue</i>!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Not so <span class='sc'>Miranda</span>! She is ever prest      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To give opinions, and she gives her best.</div>
      <div class='line'>To these with gentle smile her guests incline,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who come to hear, improve, applaud—and dine.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her hungry mind on every subject feeds;</div>
      <div class='line'>She Adam Smith and Dugald Stewart reads;</div>
      <div class='line'>Locke entertains her, and she wonders why</div>
      <div class='line'>His famous Essay is consider’d dry.</div>
      <div class='line'>For her amusement in her vacant hours</div>
      <div class='line'>Are earths and rocks, and animals and flowers;</div>
      <div class='line'>She could the farmer at his work assist,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A systematic agriculturist.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some men, indeed, would curb the female mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor let us see that they themselves are blind;</div>
      <div class='line'>But—thank our stars!—the liberal times allow,</div>
      <div class='line'>That all may think, and men have rivals now.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Miranda deems all knowledge might be gain’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>“But she is idle, nor has much attain’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Men are in her deceived: she knows at most</div>
      <div class='line'>A few light matters, for she scorns to boast.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her mathematic studies she resign’d—      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They did not suit the genius of her mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>She thought indeed the higher parts sublime,</div>
      <div class='line'>But then they took a monstrous deal of time!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Frequent and full the letters she delights</div>
      <div class='line'>To read in part; she names not him who writes—</div>
      <div class='line'>But here and there a precious sentence shows,</div>
      <div class='line'>Telling what literary debts she owes.</div>
      <div class='line'>Works, yet unprinted, for her judgment come,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Alas!” she cries, “and I must seal their doom.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sworn to be just, the judgment gives me pain—      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Ah! why must truth be told, or man be vain?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Much she has written, and still deigns to write,</div>
      <div class='line'>But not an effort yet must see the light.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>“Cruel!” her friends exclaim; “unkind, unjust!”</div>
      <div class='line'>But, no! the envious mass she will not trust;</div>
      <div class='line'>Content to hear that fame is due to her,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which on her works the world might not confer—</div>
      <div class='line'>Content with loud applauses while she lives;</div>

      <div class='line'>No art coquettish, nothing of the prude;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>One of the name, who roved the world around,</div>
      <div class='line'>At length had something of its treasures found,</div>
      <div class='line'>And childless died, amid his goods and gain,</div>
      <div class='line'>In far Barbadoes on the western main.</div>
      <div class='line'>His kinsman heard, and wish’d the wealth to share,</div>
      <div class='line'>But had no mind to be transported there:</div>
      <div class='line'>“His Wife could sail—her courage who could doubt?—      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And she was not tormented with the gout.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She liked it not; but for his children’s sake,</div>
      <div class='line'>And for their father’s, would the duty take.</div>
      <div class='line'>Storms she encounter’d, ere she reach’d the shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>And other storms when these were heard no more—</div>
      <div class='line'>The rage of lawyers forced to drop their prey—</div>
      <div class='line'>And once again to England made her way.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She found her Husband with his gout removed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a young nurse, most skilful and approved;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom—for he yet was weak—he urged to stay,      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>And nurse him while his consort was away:—</div>
      <div class='line'>“She was so handy, so discreet, so nice,</div>
      <div class='line'>As kind as comfort, though as cold as ice!</div>
      <div class='line'>Else,” he assured his lady, “in no case,</div>
      <div class='line'>So young a creature should have fill’d the place.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It has been held—indeed, the point is clear—</div>
      <div class='line'>“None are so deaf as those who will not hear;”</div>
      <div class='line'>And, by the same good logic, we shall find,</div>
      <div class='line'>“As those who will not see, are none so blind.”</div>
      <div class='line'>The thankful Wife repaid th’ attention shown,      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But now would make the duty all her own.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Again the gout return’d; but, seizing now</div>
      <div class='line'>A vital part, would no relief allow.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Husband died, but left a will that proved</div>
      <div class='line'>He much respected whom he coolly loved.</div>
      <div class='line'>All power was hers; nor yet was such her age</div>
      <div class='line'>But rivals strove her favour to engage.</div>
      <div class='line'>They talk’d of love with so much warmth and zeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>That they believed the woman’s heart must feel;</div>
      <div class='line'>Adding such praises of her worth beside,      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As vanquish prudence oft by help of pride.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In vain! her heart was by discretion led—</div>
      <div class='line'>She to the children of her Friend was wed;</div>
      <div class='line'>These she establish’d in the world, and died,</div>
      <div class='line'>In ease and hope, serene and satisfied.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And loves not man that woman who can charm</div>
      <div class='line'>Life’s grievous ills, and grief itself disarm;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who in his fears and troubles brings him aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And seldom is, and never seems, afraid?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>No! ask of man the fair one whom he loves:      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>You’ll find her one of the desponding doves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who tender troubles as her portion brings,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with them fondly to a husband clings—</div>
      <div class='line'>Who never moves abroad, nor sits at home,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without distress, past, present, or to come—</div>
      <div class='line'>Who never walks the unfrequented street,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without a dread that death and she shall meet:</div>
      <div class='line'>At land, on water, she must guarded be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who sees the danger none besides her see,</div>
      <div class='line'>And is determined by her cries to call      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>All men around her: she will have them all.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Man loves to think the tender being lives</div>
      <div class='line'>But by the power that his protection gives:</div>
      <div class='line'>He loves the feeble step, the plaintive tone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And flies to help who cannot stand alone;</div>
      <div class='line'>He thinks of propping elms and clasping vines,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in her weakness thinks her virtue shines;</div>
      <div class='line'>On him not one of her desires is lost,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he admires her for this care and cost.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But, when afflictions come, when beauty dies,      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or sorrows vex the heart, or danger tries—</div>
      <div class='line'>When time of trouble brings the daily care,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gives of pain as much as he can bear:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis then he wants, if not the helping hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>At least a soothing temper, meek and bland;</div>
      <div class='line'>He wants the heart that shares in his distress—</div>
      <div class='line'>At least, the kindness that would make it less;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when, instead, he hears th’ eternal grief</div>
      <div class='line'>For some light want, and not for his relief—</div>
      <div class='line'>And when he hears the tender trembler sigh      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For some indulgence he cannot supply—</div>
      <div class='line'>When, in the midst of many a care, his “dear”</div>
      <div class='line'>Would like a duchess at a ball appear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, while he feels a weight that wears him down,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would see the prettiest sight in all the town—</div>
      <div class='line'>Love then departs; and, if some Pity lives,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Pity half despises, half forgives;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis join’d with grief, is not from shame exempt,</div>
      <div class='line'>And has a plenteous mixture of contempt.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>O</span>f all the beauties in our favour’d place,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Belinda Waters</span> was the pride and grace.</div>
      <div class='line'>Say ye, who sagely can our fortunes read,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall this fair damsel in the world succeed?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A rosy beauty she, and fresh and fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who never felt a caution or a care;</div>
      <div class='line'>Gentle by nature, ever fond of ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>And more consenting than inclined to please.</div>
      <div class='line'>A tame good nature in her spirit lives—</div>
      <div class='line'>She hates refusal for the pain it gives:      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>From opposition arguments arise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, to prevent the trouble, she complies.</div>
      <div class='line'>She, if in Scotland, would be <i>fash’d</i> all day,</div>
      <div class='line'>If call’d to any work or any play;</div>
      <div class='line'>She lets no busy, idle wish intrude,</div>
      <div class='line'>But is by nature negatively good.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In marriage hers will be a dubious fate:</div>
      <div class='line'>She is not fitted for a high estate—</div>
      <div class='line'>There wants the grace, the polish, and the pride;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Less is she fitted for a humble bride:      <span class='linenum'>20}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Whom fair Belinda weds—let chance decide!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>She sees her father oft engross’d by cares,</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore hates to hear of men’s affairs.</div>
      <div class='line'>An active mother in the household reigns,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>And spares Belinda all domestic pains;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of food she knows but this, that we are fed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though, duly taught, she prays for daily bread,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, whence it comes, of hers is no concern—</div>
      <div class='line'>It comes; and more she never wants to learn.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She on the table sees the common fare,      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But, how provided, is beneath her care.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lovely and useless, she has no concern</div>
      <div class='line'>About the things that aunts and mothers learn;</div>
      <div class='line'>But thinks, when married—if she thinks at all—</div>
      <div class='line'>That what she needs will answer to her call.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To write is business, and, though taught to write,</div>
      <div class='line'>She keeps the pen and paper out of sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>What once was painful she cannot allow</div>
      <div class='line'>To be enjoyment or amusement now.</div>
      <div class='line'>She wonders why the ladies are so fond      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of such long letters, when they correspond;</div>
      <div class='line'>Crowded and cross’d by ink of different stain,</div>
      <div class='line'>She thinks to read them would confuse her brain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor much mistakes; but still has no pretence</div>
      <div class='line'>To praise for this, her critic’s indolence.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Behold her now! she on her sofa looks</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er half a shelf of circulating books.</div>
      <div class='line'>This she admired, but she forgets the name,</div>
      <div class='line'>And reads again another, or the same.</div>
      <div class='line'>She likes to read of strange and bold escapes,      <span class='linenum'>50}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of plans and plottings, murders and mishaps,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Love in all hearts, and lovers in all shapes.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She sighs for pity, and her sorrows flow</div>
      <div class='line'>From the dark eyelash on the page below;</div>
      <div class='line'>And is so glad when, all the misery past,</div>
      <div class='line'>The dear adventurous lovers meet at last—</div>
      <div class='line'>Meet and are happy; and she thinks it hard,</div>
      <div class='line'>When thus an author might a pair reward—</div>
      <div class='line'>When they, the troubles all dispersed, might wed—</div>
      <div class='line'>He makes them part, and die of grief instead!      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet tales of terror are her dear delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>All in the wintry storm to read at night;</div>
      <div class='line'>And to her maid she turns in all her doubt,—</div>
      <div class='line'>“This shall I like? and what is that about?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>She had “Clarissa” for her heart’s dear friend—</div>
      <div class='line'>Was pleased each well-tried virtue to commend.</div>
      <div class='line'>And praised the scenes that one might fairly doubt</div>
      <div class='line'>If one so young could know so much about.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pious and pure, th’ heroic beauty strove</div>
      <div class='line'>Against the lover and against the love;      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But strange that maid so young should know the strife,</div>
      <div class='line'>In all its views, was painted to the life!</div>
      <div class='line'>Belinda knew not—nor a tale would read,</div>
      <div class='line'>That could so slowly on its way proceed;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, ere Clarissa reach’d the wicked town,</div>
      <div class='line'>The weary damsel threw the volume down.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Give me,” she said, “for I would laugh or cry,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Scenes from the Life,’ and ‘Sensibility;’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Winters at Bath,’—I would that I had one!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>‘The Constant Lover,’ the ‘Discarded Son,’      <span class='linenum'>80}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>‘The Rose of Raby,’ ‘Delmore,’ or ‘The Nun.’      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>These promise something, and may please, perhaps,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like ‘Ethelinda,’ and the dear ‘Relapse.’”</div>
      <div class='line'>To these her heart the gentle maid resign’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And such the food that fed the gentle mind.</div>

      <div class='line in2'><i>P.</i> Knew you the fair <span class='sc'>Belinda</span>, once the boast</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a vain mother, and a favourite toast</div>
      <div class='line'>Of clerks and young lieutenants, a gay set</div>
      <div class='line'>Of light admirers?—Is she married yet?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>F.</i> Yes! she is married; though she waited long,      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Not from a prudent fear of choosing wrong,</div>
      <div class='line'>But want of choice.—She took a surgeon’s mate,</div>
      <div class='line'>With his half-pay, that was his whole estate.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Fled is the charming bloom that nature spread      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Upon her cheek, the pure, the rosy red—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>This, and the look serene, the calm, kind look, are fled.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Sorrow and sadness now the place possess,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the pale cast of anxious fretfulness.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She <i>wonders</i> much—as, why they live so ill;</div>
      <div class='line'>Why the rude butcher brings his weekly bill;      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She wonders why that baker will not trust,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>And says, most truly says,—“Indeed, he must.”</div>
      <div class='line'>She wonders where her former friends are gone—</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus, from day to day, she wonders on.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Howe’er she can—she dresses gaily yet,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then she wonders how they came in debt.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her husband loves her, and in accent mild</div>
      <div class='line'>Answers, and treats her like a fretted child;</div>
      <div class='line'>But when he, ruffled, makes severe replies,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And seems unhappy—then she pouts, and cries      <span class='linenum'>110}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“She wonders when she’ll die!”—She faints, but never dies.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“How well my father lived!” she says.—“How well,</div>
      <div class='line'>My dear, your father’s creditors could tell!”</div>
      <div class='line'>And then she weeps, till comfort is applied,</div>
      <div class='line'>That soothes her spleen or gratifies her pride:</div>
      <div class='line'>Her dress and novels, visits and success</div>
      <div class='line'>In a chance-game, are soft’ners of distress.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So life goes on!—But who, that loved his life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would take a fair Belinda for his wife!</div>
      <div class='line'>Who thinks that all are for their stations born,      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Some to indulge themselves, and to adorn;</div>
      <div class='line'>And some, a useful people, to prepare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not being rich, good things for those who are,</div>
      <div class='line'>And who are born, it cannot be denied,</div>
      <div class='line'>To have their wants and their demands supplied.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She knows that money is a needful thing,</div>
      <div class='line'>That fathers first, and then that husbands bring;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or, if those persons should the aid deny,</div>
      <div class='line'>Daughters and wives have but to faint and die,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till flesh and blood cannot endure the pain;      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>To take the pestilence with poison’d breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wed some potent minister of death,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is cruel fate—yet death is then relief;</div>
      <div class='line'>But thus to wed is ever-during grief.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oft have I heard, how blest the youth who weds</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Yet, ere I go, some notice must be paid</div>
      <div class='line'>To <span class='sc'>John</span>, his Clerk, a man full sore afraid</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his own frailty—many a troubled day</div>
      <div class='line'>Has he walk’d doubtful in some close by-way,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beseeching Conscience on her watch to keep,      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Afraid that she one day should fall asleep.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A quiet man was John; his mind was slow;</div>
      <div class='line'>Little he knew, and little sought to know.</div>
      <div class='line'>He gave respect to worth, to riches more,</div>
      <div class='line'>And had instinctive dread of being poor.</div>
      <div class='line'>Humble and careful, diligent and neat,</div>
      <div class='line'>He in the Dealer’s office found a seat;</div>
      <div class='line'>Happy in all things, till a fear began</div>
      <div class='line'>To break his rest—He served a wicked man,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who spurn’d the way direct of honest trade,      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>But praised the laws his cunning could evade.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This crafty Dealer of religion spoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if design’d to be the wise man’s cloak,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the weak man’s encumbrance, whom it awes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And keeps in dread of conscience and the laws.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, for himself, he loved not to appear</div>
      <div class='line'>In her grave dress; ’twas troublesome to wear.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This Dealer played at games of skill, and won</div>
      <div class='line'>Sums that surprised the simple mind of John;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor trusted skill alone; for well he knew,      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What a sharp eye and dext’rous hand could do;</div>
      <div class='line'>When, if suspected, he had always by</div>
      <div class='line'>The daring oath to back the cunning lie.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>John was distress’d, and said, with aching heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>“I from the vile, usurious man must part;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, if I go not—yet I mean to go—</div>
      <div class='line'>This friend to me will to my soul be foe.</div>
      <div class='line'>I serve my master: there is nought to blame;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, whom he serves, I tremble but to name.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From such reflections sprung the painful fear—      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“The Foe of Souls is too familiar here;</div>
      <div class='line'>My master stands between: so far, so good;</div>
      <div class='line'>But ’tis at best a dangerous neighbourhood.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then livelier thoughts began this fear to chase—</div>
      <div class='line'>“It is a gainful, a convenient place.</div>
      <div class='line'>If I should quit—another takes the pen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what a chance for my preferment then?</div>
      <div class='line'>Religion nothing by my going gains;</div>
      <div class='line'>If I depart, my master still remains.</div>
      <div class='line'>True, I record the deeds that I abhor,      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But these that master has to answer for.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then say, I leave the office: his success,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his injustice, will not be the less;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, would be greater—I am right to stay;</div>
      <div class='line'>It checks him, doubtless, in his fearful way.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fain would I stay, and yet be not beguiled;</div>
      <div class='line'>But pitch is near, and man is soon defiled.”</div>

      <div class='line'>Would know if they together live, and how.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To such enquiries, thus my Friend replied:—      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><i>F.</i> The Wife was slain—or, say at least, she died.</div>
      <div class='line'>But there are murders that the human eye</div>
      <div class='line'>Cannot detect—which human laws defy.</div>
      <div class='line'>There are the wrongs insulted fondness feels,</div>
      <div class='line'>In many a secret wound that never heals;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Savage murders with a single blow;</div>
      <div class='line'>Murders like this are secret and are slow.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet, when his victim lay upon her bier,</div>
      <div class='line'>There were who witness’d that he dropt a tear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, more, he praised the woman he had lost,      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And undisputed paid the funeral cost.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Favourite now, her lord and master freed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Prepared to wed, and be a wife indeed.</div>
      <div class='line'>The day, ’twas said, was fix’d, the robes were bought,</div>
      <div class='line'>A feast was order’d; but a cold was caught,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pain ensued, with fever—grievous pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the mind’s anguish that disturb’d the brain—</div>
      <div class='line'>Till nature ceased to struggle, and the mind</div>
      <div class='line'>Saw clearly death before, and sin behind.</div>
      <div class='line'>Priests and physicians gave what they could give;      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She turn’d away, and, shuddering, ceased to live.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Dealer now appeared awhile as one</div>
      <div class='line'>Lost, with but little of his race to run,</div>
      <div class='line'>And that in sorrow; men with one consent,</div>
      <div class='line'>And one kind hope, said, “Bonner will repent.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! we saw not what his fate would be,</div>
      <div class='line'>But this we fear’d—no penitence had he;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor time for penitence, nor any time,</div>
      <div class='line'>So quick the summons, to look back on crime.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When he the partner of his sin entomb’d,      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He paused awhile, and then the way resumed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ev’n as before; yet was he not the same:</div>
      <div class='line'>The tempter once, he now the dupe became.</div>
      <div class='line'>John long had left him, nor did one remain</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Who would his harlot in her course refrain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Obsequious, humble, studious of his ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>The present Phœbe only sought to please.</div>
      <div class='line'>“With one so artless, what,” said he, “to fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or what to doubt, in one who holds me dear?</div>
      <div class='line'>Friends she may have, but me she will not wrong;      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>If weak her judgment, yet her love is strong;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I am lucky now in age to find</div>
      <div class='line'>A friend so trusty, and a nurse so kind.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet neither party was in peace; the man</div>
      <div class='line'>Had restless nights, and in the morn began</div>
      <div class='line'>To cough and tremble; he was hot and cold—</div>
      <div class='line'>He had a nervous fever, he was told.</div>
      <div class='line'>His dreams—’twas strange, for none reflected less</div>
      <div class='line'>On his past life—were frightful to excess;</div>
      <div class='line'>His favourite dinners were no more enjoy’d,      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, in a word, his spirits were destroy’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And what of Phœbe? She her measures plann’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>All but his money was at her command;</div>
      <div class='line'>All would be hers, when Heav’n her Friend should call;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Heav’n was slow, and much she long’d for all:—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Mine when he dies, mean wretch! and why not mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>When it would prove him generous to resign</div>
      <div class='line'>What he enjoys not!”—Phœbe, at command,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave him his brandy with a liberal hand.</div>
      <div class='line'>A way more quick and safe she did not know,      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And brandy, though it might be sure, was slow.</div>
      <div class='line'>But more she dared not; for she felt a dread</div>
      <div class='line'>Of being tried, and only wish’d him dead.</div>
      <div class='line'>Such was her restless strife of hope and fear—</div>
      <div class='line'>He might cough on for many a weary year;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, his poor mind was changing, and, when ill,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Some foe to her may wicked thoughts instil!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! ’tis a trial sore to watch a Miser’s will!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Thus, though the pair appear’d in peace to live,</div>
      <div class='line'>They felt that vice has not that peace to give.      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>There watch’d a cur before the Miser’s gate—</div>
      <div class='line'>A very cur, whom all men seem’d to hate;</div>
      <div class='line'>Gaunt, savage, shaggy, with an eye that shone</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a live coal, and he possess’d but one;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>His bark was wild and eager, and became      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That meagre body and that eye of flame;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His master prized him much, and <i>Fang</i> his name.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His master fed him largely; but not that,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor aught of kindness, made the snarler fat.</div>
      <div class='line'>Flesh he devoured, but not a bit would stay;      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He bark’d, and snarl’d, and growl’d it all away.</div>
      <div class='line'>His ribs were seen extended like a rack,</div>
      <div class='line'>And coarse red hair hung roughly o’er his back.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lamed in one leg, and bruised in wars of yore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now his sore body made his temper sore.</div>
      <div class='line'>Such was the friend of him, who could not find,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor make him one, ‘mong creatures of his kind.</div>
      <div class='line'>Brave deeds of Fang his master often told,</div>
      <div class='line'>The son of Fury, famed in days of old,</div>
      <div class='line'>From Snatch and Rabid sprung; and noted they      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In earlier times—each dog will have his day.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The notes of Fang were to his master known,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dear—they bore some likeness to his own;</div>
      <div class='line'>For both convey’d to the experienced ear,</div>
      <div class='line'>“I snarl and bite, because I hate and fear.”</div>
      <div class='line'>None pass’d ungreeted by the master’s door;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fang rail’d at all, but chiefly at the poor;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when the nights were stormy, cold, and dark,</div>
      <div class='line'>The act of Fang was a perpetual bark;</div>
      <div class='line'>But though the master loved the growl of Fang,      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>There were who vow’d the ugly cur to hang;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose angry master, watchful for his friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>As strongly vow’d his servant to defend.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In one dark night, and such as Fang before</div>
      <div class='line'>Was ever known its tempests to outroar,</div>
      <div class='line'>To his protector’s wonder now express’d</div>
      <div class='line'>No angry notes—his anger was at rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>The wond’ring master sought the silent yard,</div>
      <div class='line'>Left Phœbe sleeping, and his door unbarr’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor more returned to that forsaken bed—      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But lo! the morning came, and he was dead.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fang and his master side by side were laid</div>
      <div class='line'>In grim repose—their debt of nature paid!</div>
      <div class='line'>The master’s hand upon the cur’s cold chest</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Was now reclined, and had before been press’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if he search’d how deep and wide the wound</div>
      <div class='line'>That laid such spirit in a sleep so sound;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when he found it was the sleep of death,</div>
      <div class='line'>A sympathising sorrow stopp’d his breath.</div>
      <div class='line'>Close to his trusty servant he was found,      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As cold his body, and his sleep as sound.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>We know no more; but who on horrors dwell</div>
      <div class='line'>Of that same night have dreadful things to tell.</div>
      <div class='line'>Of outward force, they say, was not a sign—</div>
      <div class='line'>The hand that struck him was the Hand Divine;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then the Fiend, in that same stormy night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was heard—as many thought—to claim his right;</div>
      <div class='line'>While grinning imps the body danced about,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then they vanish’d with triumphant shout.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So think the crowd, and well it seems in them,      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That ev’n their dreams and fancies vice condemn;</div>
      <div class='line'>That not alone for virtue Reason pleads,</div>
      <div class='line'>But Nature shudders at unholy deeds;</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>Scruples like his were treated with disdain,</div>

      <div class='line'>“I dare not do it,” said the affrighten’d John.</div>
      <div class='line'>“What fear’st thou, driveller! can thy fancy tell?”</div>
      <div class='line'>“I doubt,” said John—“I’m sure, there is a hell.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“No question, wretch! thy foot is on the door;</div>
      <div class='line'>To be in hell, thou fool! is to be poor.</div>
      <div class='line'>Wilt thou consent?”—But John, with many a sigh,      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Refused, then sank beneath his stronger eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who with a curse dismiss’d the fool that dared</div>

      <div class='line in2'>The worthy Clerk then served a man in trade,</div>

      <div class='line'>To John his views and business he consign’d,      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>As sickness bore him onward to the grave,</div>
      <div class='line'>A charge of all things to his friend he gave.</div>

      <div class='line'>When Richard Shale should walk the dark highway—</div>
      <div class='line'>And whisper’d—tatlers!—that the wife received</div>
      <div class='line'>Such hints with anger, but she nothing grieved.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>These whispers reach’d the man, who weak, and ill</div>
      <div class='line'>In mind and body, had to make his will;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, though he died in peace, and all resign’d,      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas plain he harbour’d fancies in his mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>With jealous foresight, all that he had gain’d</div>
      <div class='line'>His widow’s was, while widow she remain’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, if another should the dame persuade</div>

      <div class='line in2'>The man was buried, and the will was read,</div>

      <div class='line'>It put the pair in mind of breaking laws,</div>
      <div class='line'>Led them to reason what it was that gave      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A husband power, when quiet in his grave.</div>
      <div class='line'>The marriage contract they had now by heart—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Till death!”—you see, no longer—“do us part.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Well! death has loosed us from the tie, but still</div>
      <div class='line'>The loosen’d husband makes a binding will;</div>
      <div class='line'>Unjust and cruel are the acts of men.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Thus they—and then they sigh’d—and then—and then,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas snaring souls,” they said; and how he dared</div>
      <div class='line'>They did not know—they wonder’d—and were snared.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“It is a marriage, surely! Conscience might      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Allow an act so very nearly right;</div>
      <div class='line'>Was it not witness to our solemn vow,</div>
      <div class='line'>As man and wife? it must the act allow.”</div>
      <div class='line'>But Conscience, stubborn to the last, replied,</div>
      <div class='line'>“It cannot be! I am not satisfied;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis not a marriage: either dare be poor,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or dare be virtuous—part, and sin no more!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Alas! they many a fond evasion made;</div>
      <div class='line'>They could relinquish neither love nor trade.</div>
      <div class='line'>They went to church, but, thinking, fail’d to pray;      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They felt not ease or comfort at a play.</div>
      <div class='line'>If times were good—“We merit not such times;”</div>
      <div class='line'>If ill—“Is this the produce of our crimes?”</div>
      <div class='line'>When sick—“’Tis thus forbidden pleasures cease;”</div>
      <div class='line'>When well—they both demand, “Had Zimri peace?</div>
      <div class='line'>For though our worthy master was not slain,</div>
      <div class='line'>His injured ghost has reason to complain.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ah, John! bethink thee of thy generous joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>When Conscience drove thee from thy late employ;</div>
      <div class='line'>When thou wert poor, and knew not where to run,      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But then could say, “The will of God be done!”</div>
      <div class='line'>When thou that will, and not thine own, obey’d—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>Of Him alone, and not of man afraid.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou then hadst pity on that wretch, and, free</div>
      <div class='line'>Thyself, couldst pray for him who injured thee;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then how alert thy step, thyself how light</div>
      <div class='line'>All the day long! thy sleep how sound at night!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But now, though plenty on thy board be found,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou hast credit with thy neighbours round,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet there is something in thy looks that tells,      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>An odious secret in thy bosom dwells.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy form is not erect, thy neighbours trace</div>
      <div class='line'>A coward spirit in thy shifting pace.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou goest to meeting, not from any call,</div>
      <div class='line'>But just to hear, that we are sinners all—</div>
      <div class='line'>And equal sinners, or the difference made</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twixt man and man has but the slightest shade;</div>
      <div class='line'>That reformation asks a world of pains,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, after all, must leave a thousand stains;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, worst of all, we must the work begin      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>By first attacking the prevailing sin!—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>These thoughts the feeble mind of John assail,</div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er his reason and his fears prevail;</div>
      <div class='line'>They fill his mind with hopes of gifts and grace,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Faith, feelings!—something that supplies the place      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of true conversion—this will he embrace;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For John perceives that he was scarcely tried</div>
      <div class='line'>By the first conquest, that increased his pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he refused his master’s crime to aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And by his self-applause was amply paid.      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But now he feels the difference—feels it hard</div>
      <div class='line'>Against his will and favourite wish to guard;</div>
      <div class='line'>He mourns his weakness, hopes he shall prevail</div>
      <div class='line'>Against his frailty, and yet still is frail.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such is his life! and such the life must be</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all who will be bound, yet would be free;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who would unite what God to part decrees—</div>
      <div class='line'>The offended conscience, and the mind at ease:</div>
      <div class='line'>Who think, but vainly think, to sin and pray,</div>
      <div class='line'>And God and Mammon in their turn obey.      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Such is his life!—and so I would not live</div>
      <div class='line'>For all that wealthy widows have to give.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>T</span>he purest Friendship, like the finest ware,</div>
      <div class='line'>Deserves our praises, but demands our care.</div>
      <div class='line'>For admiration we the things produce,</div>
      <div class='line'>But they are not design’d for common use;</div>
      <div class='line'>Flaws the most trifling from their virtue take,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lamentation for their loss we make;</div>
      <div class='line'>While common Friendships, like the wares of clay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are a cheap kind, but useful every day.</div>
      <div class='line'>Though crack’d and damaged, still we make them do;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when they’re broken, they’re forgotten too.      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>There is within the world in which we dwell</div>
      <div class='line'>A Friendship, answering to that world full well:</div>
      <div class='line'>An interchange of looks and actions kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, in some sense, an intercourse of mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>A useful commerce, a convenient trade,</div>
      <div class='line'>By which both parties are the happier made;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when the thing is rightly understood,</div>
      <div class='line'>And justly valued, it is wise and good.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I speak not here of Friendships that excite</div>
      <div class='line'>In boys at school such wonder and delight—      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of high, heroic Friends, in serious strife</div>
      <div class='line'>Contending which should yield a forfeit life—</div>
      <div class='line'>Such wondrous love, in their maturer days,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>Men, if they credit, are content to praise.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I speak not here of Friendships true and just,</div>
      <div class='line'>When friend can friend with life and honour trust;</div>
      <div class='line'>Where mind to mind has long familiar grown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every failing, every virtue known.</div>
      <div class='line'>Of these I speak not—things so rich and rare,</div>
      <div class='line'>That we degrade with jewels to compare,      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or bullion pure and massy.—I intend</div>
      <div class='line'>To treat of one whose Neighbour called him Friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or called him Neighbour; and with reason good—</div>
      <div class='line'>The friendship rising from the neighbourhood:</div>
      <div class='line'>A sober kind, in common service known,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not such as is in death and peril shown;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as will give or ask a helping hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>But no important sacrifice demand;</div>
      <div class='line'>In fact, a friendship that will long abide,</div>
      <div class='line'>If seldom rashly, never strongly, tried.      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yes! these are sober friendships, made for use,</div>
      <div class='line'>And much convenience they in life produce:</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a good coat, that keeps us from the cold,</div>
      <div class='line'>The cloth of frieze is not a cloth of gold;</div>
      <div class='line'>But neither is it pyebald, pieced, and poor;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis a good useful coat, and nothing more.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such is the Friendship of the world approved,</div>
      <div class='line'>And here the Friends so loving and so loved.—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Danvers</span> and <span class='sc'>Rayner</span>, equals, who had made</div>
      <div class='line'>Each decent fortune, both were yet in trade;      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>While sons and daughters, with a youthful zeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seem’d the hereditary love to feel;</div>
      <div class='line'>And ev’n their wives, though either might pretend</div>
      <div class='line'>To claim some notice, call’d each other friend.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>While yet their offspring boys and girls appear’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>The fathers ask’d, “What evil could be fear’d?”</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor is it easy to assign the year,</div>
      <div class='line'>When cautious parents should begin to fear.</div>
      <div class='line'>The boys must leave their schools, and, by and by,</div>
      <div class='line'>The girls are sure to grow reserved and shy;      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And then, suppose a real love should rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>It but unites the equal families.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Love does not always from such freedom spring;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Distrust, perhaps, would sooner cause the thing.</div>
      <div class='line'>“We will not check it, neither will we force”—</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus said the fathers—“Let it take its course.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It took its course:—young Richard Danvers’ mind</div>
      <div class='line'>In Phœbe Rayner found what lovers find—</div>
      <div class='line'>Sense, beauty, sweetness; all that mortal eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Can see, or heart conceive, or thought devise.      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And Phœbe’s eye, and thought, and heart could trace</div>
      <div class='line'>In Richard Danvers every manly grace—</div>
      <div class='line'>All that e’er maiden wish’d, or matron prized—</div>
      <div class='line'>So well these good young people sympathised.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>All their relations, neighbours, and allies,</div>
      <div class='line'>All their dependants, visitors, and spies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as a wealthy family caress,</div>
      <div class='line'>Said here was love, and drank to love’s success.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>’Tis thus I leave the parties, young and old,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lovers and Friends. Will Love and Friendship hold?      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Will Prudence with the children’s wish comply,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Friendship strengthen with that new ally?</div>

      <div class='line in2'><i>P.</i> I see no more within our borough’s bound</div>
      <div class='line'>The name of <span class='sc'>Danvers</span>! Is it to be found?</div>
      <div class='line'>Were the young pair in Hymen’s fetters tied,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or did succeeding years the Friends divide?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>F.</i> Nay! take the story, as by time brought forth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And of such Love and Friendship judge the worth.</div>
      <div class='line'>While the lad’s love—his parents call’d it so—</div>
      <div class='line'>Was going on, as well as love could go,      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A wealthy Danvers, in a distant place,</div>
      <div class='line'>Left a large fortune to this favour’d race.</div>
      <div class='line'>To that same place the father quickly went,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Richard only murmur’d weak dissent.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of Richard’s heart the parent truly guess’d:—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Well, my good lad! then do what suits thee best;</div>
      <div class='line'>No doubt thy brothers will do all they can</div>
      <div class='line'>T’ obey the orders of the good old man.</div>
      <div class='line'>Well, I would not thy free-born spirit bind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Take, Dick, the way to which thou’rt most inclined.”      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>No answer gave the youth; nor did he swear</div>
      <div class='line'>The old man’s riches were beneath his care;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor that he would with his dear Phœbe stay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And let his heartless father move away.</div>
      <div class='line'>No! kind and constant, tender, faithful, fond—</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus far he’d go—but not one step beyond!</div>
      <div class='line'>Not disobedient to a parent’s will—</div>
      <div class='line'>A lover constant—but dependent still.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Letters, at first, between the constant swain</div>
      <div class='line'>And the kind damsel banish’d all their pain.      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Both full and quick they were; for lovers write</div>
      <div class='line'>With vast despatch, and read with vast delight—</div>
      <div class='line'>So quick they were—for Love is never slow—</div>
      <div class='line'>So full, they ever seem’d to overflow.</div>
      <div class='line'>Their hearts are ever fill’d with grief or joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>And these to paint is every hour’s employ;</div>
      <div class='line'>Joy they would not retain, and, for their grief,</div>
      <div class='line'>To read such letters is a sure relief.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But, in due time, both joy and grief supprest,</div>
      <div class='line'>They found their comfort in a little rest.      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Mails went and came without the accustom’d freight,</div>
      <div class='line'>For Love grew patient, and content to wait—</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet was not dead, nor yet afraid to die;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, though he wrote not, Richard wonder’d why.</div>
      <div class='line'>He could not justly tell how letters pass’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, as to him appear’d, he wrote the last;</div>
      <div class='line'>In this he meant not to accuse the maid—</div>
      <div class='line'>Love, in some cases, ceases to upbraid.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet not indifferent was our Lover grown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Although the ardour of the flame was flown;      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He still of Phœbe thought, her lip, her smile—</div>
      <div class='line'>But grew contented with his fate the while.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus, not inconstant were the youthful pair—</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lad remembered still the Lass was fair;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Phœbe still, with half-affected sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thought it a pity that such love should die;</div>
      <div class='line'>And had they then, with this persuasion, met,</div>
      <div class='line'>Love had rekindled, and been glowing yet.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But times were changed; no mention now was made</div>
      <div class='line'>By the old Squire, or by the young, of trade.      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>The worthy Lady, and her children all,</div>

      <div class='line'>His Worship now read Burn, and talk’d with skill</div>
      <div class='line'>About the poor-house, and the turnpike-bill;</div>
      <div class='line'>Lord of a manor, he had serious claims,</div>
      <div class='line'>And knew the poaching rascals by their names.</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if the father thus improved his mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be sure the children were not far behind:</div>
      <div class='line'>To rank and riches what respect was due,</div>
      <div class='line'>To them and theirs what deference, well they knew,      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, from the greatest to the least, could show</div>
      <div class='line'>What to the favouring few the favour’d many owe.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The mind of man must have whereon to work,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or it will rust—we see it in the Turk;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Justice Danvers, though he read the news,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all of law that magistrates peruse—</div>
      <div class='line'>Bills about roads and charities—yet still</div>
      <div class='line'>Wanted employ his vacant mind to fill;</div>
      <div class='line'>These were not like the shipping, once his pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now, with his blue surtout, laid all aside.      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>No doubt, his spirits in their ebb to raise,</div>
      <div class='line'>He found some help in men’s respect and praise—</div>
      <div class='line'>Praise of his house, his land, his lawn, his trees—</div>
      <div class='line'>He cared not what—to praise him was to please:</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, though his rural neighbours called to dine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And some might kindly praise his food and wine,</div>
      <div class='line'>This was not certain, and, another day,</div>
      <div class='line'>He must the visit and the praise repay.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>By better motives urged—we will suppose—</div>
      <div class='line'>He thus began his purpose to disclose      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To his good lady:—“We have lived a year,</div>
      <div class='line'>And never ask’d our friends the Rayners here.</div>
      <div class='line'>Do let us ask them—as for Richard’s flame,</div>
      <div class='line'>It went, we see, as idly as it came—</div>
      <div class='line'>Invite them kindly—here’s a power of room,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the poor people will be glad to come.</div>
      <div class='line'>Outside and in, the coach will hold them all,</div>
      <div class='line'>And set them down beside the garden wall.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Lady wrote, for that was all he meant,</div>
      <div class='line'>Kind soul! by asking for his wife’s assent;      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>And every Rayner was besought to come</div>
      <div class='line'>To dine in Hulver Hall’s grand dining-room.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>About this time old Rayner, who had lost</div>
      <div class='line'>His Friend’s advice, was by misfortune cross’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>Some debtors fail’d, when large amounts were due,</div>
      <div class='line'>So large, that he was nearly failing too;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he, grown wary, that he might not fail,</div>
      <div class='line'>Brought to in adverse gales, and shorten’d sail;</div>
      <div class='line'>This done, he rested, and could now attend</div>
      <div class='line'>The invitation of his distant Friend.      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Well! he would go; but not, indeed, t’ admire</div>
      <div class='line'>The state and grandeur of the new-made Squire;</div>
      <div class='line'>Danvers, belike, now wealthy, might impart</div>
      <div class='line'>Some of his gold; for Danvers had a heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>And may have heard, though guarded so around,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I have lost the fortune he has found.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes! Dick is kind, or he and his fine seat</div>
      <div class='line'>Might go to——where we never more should meet.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now, lo! the Rayners all at Hulver Place—</div>
      <div class='line'>Or Hulver Hall—’tis not a certain case;      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis only known that Ladies’ notes were sent</div>
      <div class='line'>Directed both ways, and they always went.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>We pass the greetings, and the dinner pass,</div>
      <div class='line'>All the male gossip o’er the sparkling glass,</div>
      <div class='line'>And female, when retired.—The Squire invites</div>
      <div class='line'>His Friend, by sleep refresh’d, to see his sights—</div>
      <div class='line'>His land and lions, granary, barns, and crops,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His dairy, piggery, pinery, apples, hops;—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But here a hill appears, and Peter Rayner stops.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Ah! my old Friend, I give you joy,” he cries;      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“But some are born to fall, and some to rise;</div>
      <div class='line'>You’re better many a thousand, I the worse—</div>
      <div class='line'>Dick, there’s no dealing with a failing purse;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor does it shame me (mine is all mischance)</div>
      <div class='line'>To wish some friendly neighbour would advance”—</div>
      <div class='line'>——But here the guest on such a theme was low.</div>
      <div class='line'>His host, meantime, intent upon the show,</div>
      <div class='line'>In hearing heard not—they came out to see—</div>
      <div class='line'>And, pushing forward, “There’s a view,” quoth he;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Observe that ruin, built, you see, to catch      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>The gazer’s eye; that cottage with the thatch—</div>
      <div class='line'>It cost me—guess you what?”—that sound of <i>cost</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Was accidental, but it was not lost.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Ah! my good Friend, be sure such things as these</div>
      <div class='line'>Suit well enough a man who lives at ease.</div>
      <div class='line'>Think what ‘The Betsy’ <i>cost</i>, and think the shock</div>
      <div class='line'>Of losing her upon the Dodder-Rock!</div>
      <div class='line'>The tidings reach’d me on the very day</div>
      <div class='line'>That villain robb’d us, and then ran away.</div>
      <div class='line'>Loss upon loss! now if”——</div>
      <div class='line in30'>“Do stay a bit;”      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Exclaim’d the Squire, “these matters hardly fit</div>
      <div class='line'>A morning ramble—let me show you now</div>
      <div class='line'>My team of oxen, and my patent plough.</div>
      <div class='line'>Talk of your horses! I the plan condemn—</div>
      <div class='line'>They eat us up—but oxen! we eat them;</div>
      <div class='line'>For first they plough and bring us bread to eat,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then we fat and kill them—there’s the meat.</div>
      <div class='line'>What’s your opinion?”—</div>
      <div class='line in20'>—“I am poorly fed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And much afraid to want both meat and bread,”</div>
      <div class='line'>Said Rayner, half indignant; and the Squire      <span class='linenum'>240}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Sigh’d, as he felt he must no more require      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A man, whose prospects fail’d, his prospects to admire.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Homeward they moved, and met a gentle pair,</div>
      <div class='line'>The poor man’s daughter, and the rich man’s heir.</div>
      <div class='line'>This caused some thought; but on the couple went,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a soft hour in tender converse spent.</div>
      <div class='line'>This pair, in fact, their passion roused anew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Alone much comfort from the visit drew.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At home the Ladies were engaged, and all</div>
      <div class='line'>Show’d or were shown the wonders of the Hall;      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>From room to room the weary guests went on,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till every Rayner wish’d the show was done.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Home they return’d; the Father deeply sigh’d      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To find he vainly had for aid applied;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It hurt him much to ask—and more to be denied.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The younger Richard, who alone sustain’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The dying Friendship, true to Love remain’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>His Phœbe’s smiles, although he did not yet</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Fly to behold, he could not long forget;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor durst he visit, nor was love so strong,      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That he could more than think his Father wrong;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, wrong or right, that father still profess’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The most obedient son should fare the best.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So time pass’d on; the second spring appear’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere Richard ventured on the deed he fear’d.—</div>
      <div class='line'>He dared at length; and not so much for love,</div>
      <div class='line'>I grieve to add, but that he meant to prove</div>
      <div class='line'>He had a will.—His father, in reply,</div>
      <div class='line'>This known, had answer’d, “So, my son, have I.”</div>
      <div class='line'>But Richard’s courage was by prudence taught,      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And he his nymph in secret service sought.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some days of absence—not with full consent,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But with slow leave—were to entreaty lent;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And forth the Lover rode, uncertain what he meant.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>He reached the dwelling he had known so long,</div>
      <div class='line'>When a pert damsel told him, “he was wrong;</div>
      <div class='line'>Their house she did not just precisely know,</div>
      <div class='line'>But he would find it somewhere in <i>the Row</i>;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Rayners now were come a little down,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor more the topmost people in the town.”      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She might have added, they their life enjoy’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Although on things less hazardous employ’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This was not much; but yet the damsel’s sneer,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the Row-dwelling of a lass so dear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were somewhat startling. He had heard, indeed,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Rayner’s business did not well succeed:</div>
      <div class='line'>“But what of that? They lived in decent style,</div>
      <div class='line'>No doubt, and Phœbe still retain’d her smile;</div>
      <div class='line'>And why,” he asked, “should all men choose to dwell</div>
      <div class='line'>In broad cold streets?—the Row does just as well,      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Quiet and snug;” and then the favourite maid</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose in his fancy, tastefully array’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Looking with grateful joy upon the swain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who could his love in trying times retain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Soothed by such thoughts, to the new house he came,</div>
      <div class='line'>Surveyed its aspect, sigh’d, and gave his name.</div>
      <div class='line'>But ere they opened, he had waited long,</div>
      <div class='line'>And heard a movement—Was there somewhat wrong?</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Nay, but a friendly party, he was told;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And look’d around, as wishing to behold      <span class='linenum'>300}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Some friends—but these were not the friends of old.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Old Peter Rayner, in his own old mode,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bade the Squire welcome to his new abode,</div>
      <div class='line'>For Richard had been kind, and doubtless meant</div>
      <div class='line'>To make proposals now, and ask consent.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mamma and misses, too, were civil all;</div>
      <div class='line'>But what their awkward courtesy to call,</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew not; neither could he well express</div>
      <div class='line'>His sad sensations at their strange address.</div>
      <div class='line'>And then their laughter loud, their story-telling,      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>All seem’d befitting to that Row and dwelling;</div>
      <div class='line'>The hearty welcome to the various treat</div>
      <div class='line'>Was lost on him—he could nor laugh nor eat.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But one thing pleased him, when he look’d around,</div>
      <div class='line'>His clearest Phœbe could not there be found:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Wise and discreet,” he says, “she shuns the crew</div>
      <div class='line'>Of vulgar neighbours, some kind act to do;</div>
      <div class='line'>In some fair house, some female friend to meet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or take at evening prayer in church her seat.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Meantime there rose, amid the ceaseless din,      <span class='linenum'>320}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A mingled scent, that crowded room within,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Rum and red-herring, Cheshire cheese and gin;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Pipes, too, and punch, and sausages, with tea,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were things that Richard was disturbed to see.</div>
      <div class='line'>Impatient now, he left them in disdain,</div>
      <div class='line'>To call on Phœbe, when he call’d again;</div>
      <div class='line'>To walk with her, the morning fair and bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lose the painful feelings of the night.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>All in the Row, and tripping at the side</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a young Sailor, he the nymph espied,      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As, homeward hastening with her happy boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>She went to join the party, and enjoy.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Fie!” Phœbe cried, as her companion spoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet laugh’d to hear the fie-compelling joke;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Then ’twas her chance to meet, her shame to know,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her tender Richard, moving sad and slow,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Musing on things full strange, the manners of the Row.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>At first amazed, and then alarm’d, the fair</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Late-laughing maid now stood in dumb despair.</div>
      <div class='line'>As when a debtor meets in human shape      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The foe of debtors, and cannot escape,</div>
      <div class='line'>He stands in terror, nor can longer aim</div>
      <div class='line'>To keep his credit, or preserve his name,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood Phœbe fix’d! “Unlucky time and place!</div>
      <div class='line'>An earlier hour had kept me from disgrace!”</div>
      <div class='line'>She thought—but now the sailor, undismay’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Said, “My dear Phœbe, why are you afraid?</div>
      <div class='line'>The man seems civil, or he soon should prove</div>
      <div class='line'>That I can well defend the girl I love.</div>
      <div class='line'>Are you not mine?” She utter’d no reply:—      <span class='linenum'>350}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Thine I must be,” she thought; “more foolish I!”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>While Richard at the scene stood mute and wondering by.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>His spirits hurried, but his bosom light,</div>
      <div class='line'>He left his Phœbe with a calm “good night!”</div>
      <div class='line'>So Love like Friendship fell! The youth awhile</div>
      <div class='line'>Dreamt, sorely moved, of Phœbe’s witching smile—</div>
      <div class='line'>But learned in daylight visions to forego</div>
      <div class='line'>The Sailor’s laughing Lass, the Phœbe of the Row.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Home turn’d young Richard, in due time to turn,</div>
      <div class='line'>With all old Richard’s zeal, the leaves of Burn;      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And home turned Phœbe—in due time to grace</div>
      <div class='line'>A tottering cabin with a tattered race.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>T</span>he man who dwells where party-spirit reigns,</div>
      <div class='line'>May feel its triumphs, but must wear its chains;</div>
      <div class='line'>He must the friends and foes of party take</div>
      <div class='line'>For his, and suffer for his honour’s sake;</div>
      <div class='line'>When once enlisted upon either side,</div>
      <div class='line'>He must the rude septennial storm abide—</div>
      <div class='line'>A storm that when its utmost rage is gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>In cold and angry mutterings murmurs on;</div>
      <div class='line'>A slow unbending scorn, a cold disdain—</div>
      <div class='line'>Till years bring the full tempest back again.      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Within our Borough two stiff sailors dwelt,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who both this party storm and triumph felt;</div>
      <div class='line'>Men who had talents, and were both design’d</div>
      <div class='line'>For better things, but anger made them blind.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In the same year they married, and their wives</div>
      <div class='line'>Had pass’d in friendship their yet peaceful lives,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as they married in a time of peace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had no suspicion that their love must cease.</div>
      <div class='line'>In fact it did not; but they met by stealth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And that perhaps might keep their love in health;      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Like children watch’d, desirous yet afraid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their visits all were with discretion paid.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One Captain, so by courtesy we call</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Our [hoys’] commanders—they are captains all—</div>
      <div class='line'>Had sons and daughters many; while but one</div>
      <div class='line'>The rival Captain bless’d—a darling son.</div>
      <div class='line'>Each was a burgess to his party tied,</div>
      <div class='line'>And each was fix’d, but on a different side;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he who sought his son’s pure mind to fill</div>
      <div class='line'>With wholesome food, would evil too instil.      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The last in part succeeded—but in part—</div>
      <div class='line'>For Charles had sense, had virtue, had a heart;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he had soon the cause of Nature tried</div>
      <div class='line'>With the stern father, but this father died;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who on his death-bed thus his son address’d:—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Swear to me, Charles, and let my spirit rest—</div>
      <div class='line'>Swear to our party to be ever true,</div>
      <div class='line'>And let me die in peace—I pray thee, do.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With some reluctance, but obedience more,</div>
      <div class='line'>The weeping youth reflected, sigh’d, and swore;      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Trembling, he swore for ever to be true,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wear no colour but the untainted Blue.</div>
      <div class='line'>This done, the Captain died in so much joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if he’d wrought salvation for his boy.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The female friends their wishes yet retain’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>But seldom met, by female fears restrain’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet in such town, where girls and boys must meet,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every house is known in every street,</div>
      <div class='line'>Charles had before, nay since his father’s death,</div>
      <div class='line'>Met, say by chance, the young Elizabeth;      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Who was both good and graceful, and in truth</div>
      <div class='line'>Was but too pleasing to th’ observing youth;</div>
      <div class='line'>And why I know not, but the youth to her</div>
      <div class='line'>Seem’d just that being that she could prefer.</div>
      <div class='line'>Both were disposed to think that party-strife</div>
      <div class='line'>Destroy’d the happiest intercourse of life;</div>
      <div class='line'>Charles, too, his growing passion could defend—</div>
      <div class='line'>His father’s foe he call’d his mother’s friend.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mothers, indeed, he knew were ever kind;</div>
      <div class='line'>But in the Captain should he favour find?      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He doubted this—yet could he that command</div>
      <div class='line'>Which fathers love, and few its power withstand.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The mothers both agreed their joint request</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>Should to the Captain jointly be address’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>And first the lover should his heart assail,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And then the ladies, and, if all should fail,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They’d singly watch the hour, and jointly might prevail.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Captain’s heart, although unused to melt,</div>
      <div class='line'>A strong impression from persuasion felt;</div>
      <div class='line'>His pride was soften’d by the prayers he heard,      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And then advantage in the match appear’d.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>At length he answer’d—“Let the lad enlist</div>
      <div class='line'>In our good cause, and I no more resist;</div>
      <div class='line'>For I have sworn, and to my oath am true,</div>
      <div class='line'>To hate that colour, that rebellious Blue.</div>
      <div class='line'>His father once, ere master of the brig,</div>
      <div class='line'>For that advantage turn’d a rascal Whig;</div>
      <div class='line'>Now let the son—a wife’s a better thing—</div>
      <div class='line'>A Tory turn, and say, God save the King!</div>
      <div class='line'>For I am pledged to serve that sacred cause,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And love my country, while I keep her laws.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The women trembled, for they knew full well</div>
      <div class='line'>The fact they dare not to the Captain tell;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the poor youth declared, with tears and sighs,</div>
      <div class='line'>“My oath was pass’d; I dare not compromise.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But Charles to reason made his strong appeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to the heart—he bade him think and feel:</div>
      <div class='line'>The Captain answering, with reply as strong—</div>
      <div class='line'>“If you be right, then how can I be wrong?</div>
      <div class='line'>You to your father swore to take his part;      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I to oppose it ever, head and heart;</div>
      <div class='line'>You to a parent made your oath, and I</div>
      <div class='line'>To God! and can I to my Maker lie?</div>
      <div class='line'>Much, my dear lad, I for your sake would do,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I have sworn, and to my oath am true.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus stood the parties, when my fortunes bore</div>
      <div class='line'>Me far away from this my native shore;</div>
      <div class='line'>And who prevail’d, I know not—Young or Old;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, I beseech you, let the tale be told.</div>

      <div class='line in2'><i>P.</i> How fared these lovers? Many a time I thought      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>How with their ill-starr’d passion Time had wrought.</div>
      <div class='line'>Did either party from his oath recede,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or were they never from the bondage freed?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>F.</i> Alas! replied my Friend—the tale I tell</div>
      <div class='line'>With some reluctance, nor can do it well.</div>
      <div class='line'>There are three females in the place, and they,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like skilful painters, could the facts portray</div>
      <div class='line'>In their strong colours—all that I can do      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Is to present a weak imperfect view;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The colours I must leave—the outlines shall be true.      <span class='linenum'>110}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Soon did each party see the other’s mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>What bound them both, and what was like to bind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Oaths deeply taken in such time and place,</div>
      <div class='line'>To break them now was dreadful—was disgrace!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“That oath a dying father bade me take,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can I—yourself a father—can I break?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“That oath which I, a living sinner, took</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall I make void, and yet for mercy look?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The women wept; the men, themselves distress’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>The cruel rage of party zeal confess’d;      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But solemn oaths, though sprung from party zeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>Feel them we must, as Christians ought to feel.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet shall a youth so good, a girl so fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>From their obedience only draw despair?</div>
      <div class='line'>Must they be parted? Is there not a way</div>
      <div class='line'>For them both love and duty to obey?</div>
      <div class='line'>Strongly they hoped; and by their friends around</div>
      <div class='line'>A way, at least a lover’s way, was found.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Give up your vote; you’ll then no longer be</div>
      <div class='line'>Free in one sense, but in the better free.”      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Such was of reasoning friends the kind advice,</div>
      <div class='line'>And how could lovers in such case be nice?</div>
      <div class='line'>A man may swear to walk directly on,</div>
      <div class='line'>While sight remains; but how, if sight be gone?</div>
      <div class='line'>“Oaths are not binding when the party’s dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or when the power to keep the oath is fled;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>If I’ve no vote, I’ve neither friend nor foe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor can be said on either side to go.”</div>
      <div class='line'>They were no casuists:—“Well!” the Captain cried,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Give up your vote, man, and behold your bride!”      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus was it fix’d, and fix’d the day for both</div>
      <div class='line'>To take the vow, and set aside the oath.</div>
      <div class='line'>It gave some pain; but all agreed to say,</div>
      <div class='line'>“You’re now absolved, and have no other way.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis not expected you should love resign</div>
      <div class='line'>At man’s commands, for love’s are all divine.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When all is quiet and the mind at rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>All in the calm of innocence are blest;</div>
      <div class='line'>But when some scruple mixes with our joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>We love to give the anxious mind employ.      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>In autumn late, when evening suns were bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>The day was fix’d the lovers to unite;</div>
      <div class='line'>But one before the eager Captain chose</div>
      <div class='line'>To break, with jocund act, his girl’s repose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, sailor-like, said, “Hear how I intend</div>
      <div class='line'>One day, before the day of days, to spend!</div>
      <div class='line'>All round the quay, and by the river’s side,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall be a scene of glory for the bride.</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll have a RACE, and colours will devise</div>
      <div class='line'>For every boat, for every man, a prize;      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But that which first returns shall bear away</div>
      <div class='line'>The proudest pendant—Let us name the day!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They named the day; and never morn more bright</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose on the river, nor so proud a sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or, if too calm appear’d the cloudless skies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Experienced seamen said the wind would rise.</div>
      <div class='line'>To that full quay from this then vacant place</div>
      <div class='line'>Thronged a vast crowd to see the promised Race.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mid boats new painted, all with streamers fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>That flagg’d or flutter’d in that quiet air—      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The Captain’s boat that was so gay and trim,</div>
      <div class='line'>That made his pride, and seem’d as proud of him—</div>
      <div class='line'>Her, in her beauty, we might all discern,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her rigging new, and painted on the stern,</div>
      <div class='line'>As one who could not in the contest fail,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Learn of <i>the little Nautilus</i> to sail.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>So forth they started at the signal gun,</div>
      <div class='line'>And down the river had three leagues to run;</div>
      <div class='line'>This sail’d, they then their watery way retrace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the first landed conquers in the race.      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The crowd await, till they no more discern;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, parting, say, “At evening we return.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I could proceed; but you will guess the fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>And but too well my tale anticipate.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>P.</i> True! yet proceed—</div>
      <div class='line in22'><i>F.</i> The lovers had some grief</div>
      <div class='line'>In this day’s parting, but the time was brief;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the poor girl, between his smiles and sighs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ask’d, “Do you wish to gain so poor a prize?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But that your father wishes,” he replied,</div>
      <div class='line'>“I would the honour had been still denied:      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It makes me gloomy, though I would be gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And oh! it seems an everlasting day.”</div>
      <div class='line'>So thought the lass, and as she said, “Farewell!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Soft sighs arose, and tears unbidden fell.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The morn was calm, and ev’n till noon the strong</div>
      <div class='line'>Unruffled flood moved quietly along;</div>
      <div class='line'>In the dead calm the billows softly fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>And mock’d the whistling sea-boy’s favourite spell:</div>
      <div class='line'>So rests at noon the reaper, but to rise</div>
      <div class='line'>With mightier force and twofold energies.      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The deep, broad stream moved softly, all was hush’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>When o’er the flood the breeze awakening brush’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>A sullen sound was heard along the deep,</div>
      <div class='line'>The stormy spirit rousing from his sleep;</div>
      <div class='line'>The porpoise rolling on the troubled wave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unwieldy tokens of his pleasure gave;</div>
      <div class='line'>Dark, chilling clouds the troubled deep deform,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, led by terror downward, rush’d the storm.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As evening came, along the river’s side,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or on the quay, impatient crowds divide,      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And then collect; some whispering, as afraid</div>
      <div class='line'>Of what they saw, and more of what they said,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet must speak: how sudden and how great</div>
      <div class='line'>The danger seem’d, and what might be the fate</div>
      <div class='line'>Of men so toss’d about in craft so small,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>Lost in the dark, and subject to the squall.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then sounds are so appalling in the night,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, could we see, how terrible the sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>None knew the evils that they all suspect,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Hope at once they covet and reject.      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But where the wife, her friend, her daughter, where?</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! in grief, in terror, in despair—</div>
      <div class='line'>At home, abroad, upon the quay. No rest</div>
      <div class='line'>In any place, but where they are not, best.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fearful they ask, but dread the sad reply,</div>
      <div class='line'>And many a sailor tells the friendly lie—</div>
      <div class='line'>“There is no danger—that is, we believe,</div>
      <div class='line'>And think—and hope”—but this does not deceive,</div>
      <div class='line'>Although it soothes them; while they look around,</div>
      <div class='line'>Trembling at every sight and every sound.      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Let me not dwell on terrors——It is dark,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lights are carried to and fro, and hark!</div>
      <div class='line'>There is a cry—“a boat, a boat at hand!”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What a still terror is there now on land!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Whose, whose?” they all enquire, and none can understand.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>At length they come—and oh! how then rejoice</div>
      <div class='line'>A wife and children at that welcome voice!</div>
      <div class='line'>It is not theirs—but what have these to tell?</div>
      <div class='line'>“Where did you leave the Captain—were they well?”</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! they know not, they had felt an awe      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In dread of death, and knew not what they saw.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus they depart—The evening darker grows,</div>
      <div class='line'>The lights shake wildly, and as wildly blows</div>
      <div class='line'>The stormy night-wind; fear possesses all,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hardest hearts, in this sad interval.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But hark again to voices loud and high!</div>
      <div class='line'>Once more that hope, that dread, that agony,</div>
      <div class='line'>That panting expectation! “Oh! reveal</div>
      <div class='line'>What must be known, and think what pangs we feel!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In vain they ask! The men now landed speak      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Confused and quick, and to escape them seek.</div>
      <div class='line'>Our female party on a sailor press,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But nothing learn that makes their terror less;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nothing the man can show, or nothing will confess.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>To some, indeed, they whisper, bringing news</div>
      <div class='line'>For them alone, but others they refuse;</div>
      <div class='line'>And steal away, as if they could not bear</div>
      <div class='line'>The griefs they cause and, if they cause, must share.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They too are gone! and our unhappy Three,</div>
      <div class='line'>Half wild with fear, are trembling on the quay.      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They can no ease, no peace, no quiet find,</div>
      <div class='line'>The storm is gathering in the troubled mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thoughts after thoughts in wild succession rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all within is changing like the skies.</div>
      <div class='line'>Their friends persuade them, “Do depart, we pray!”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>They will not, must not, cannot go away,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But chill’d with icy fear, for certain tidings stay.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>And now again there must a boat be seen—</div>
      <div class='line'>Men run together! It must something mean!</div>
      <div class='line'>Some figure moves upon the [oozy] bound,      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Where flows the tide—Oh! what can he have found—</div>
      <div class='line'>What lost? And who is he?—The only one</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the loved three—the Captain’s younger son.</div>
      <div class='line'>Their boat was fill’d and sank—He knows no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>But that he only hardly reach’d the shore.</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw them swimming—for he once was near—</div>
      <div class='line'>But he was sinking, and he could not hear;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then the waves curl’d round him, but, at length,</div>
      <div class='line'>He struck upon the boat with dying strength,</div>
      <div class='line'>And that preserved him; when he turn’d around,      <span class='linenum'>280}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nought but the dark, wild, billowy flood was found—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That flood was all he saw, that flood’s the only sound—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Save that the angry wind, with ceaseless roar,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dash’d the wild waves upon the rocky shore.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Widows dwell together—so we call</div>
      <div class='line'>The younger woman; widow’d are they all;</div>
      <div class='line'>But she, the poor Elizabeth, it seems</div>
      <div class='line'>Not life in her—she lives not, but she dreams;</div>
      <div class='line'>She looks on Philip, and in him can find</div>
      <div class='line'>Not much to mark in body or in mind—      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He who was saved; and then her very soul</div>
      <div class='line'>Is in that scene—her thoughts, beyond control,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fix’d on that night, and bearing her along,</div>
      <div class='line'>Amid the waters terrible and strong;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Till there she sees within the troubled waves</div>
      <div class='line'>The bodies sinking in their wat’ry graves,</div>
      <div class='line'>When from her lover, yielding up his breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>There comes a voice,—“Farewell, Elizabeth!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet Resignation in the house is seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Subdued Affliction, Piety serene,      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And Hope, for ever striving to instil</div>
      <div class='line'>The balm for grief—“It is the Heavenly will.”</div>
      <div class='line'>And in that will our duty bids us rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>For all that Heaven ordains is good, is best;</div>
      <div class='line'>We sin and suffer—this alone we know,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grief is our portion, is our part below;</div>
      <div class='line'>But we shall rise, that world of bliss to see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where sin and suffering never more shall be.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>I</span> have remembrance of a <span class='sc'>Boy</span>, whose mind</div>
      <div class='line'>Was weak: he seem’d not for the world design’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Seem’d not as one who in that world could strive,</div>
      <div class='line'>And keep his spirits even and alive—</div>
      <div class='line'>A feeling <span class='sc'>Boy</span>, and happy, though the less,</div>
      <div class='line'>From that fine feeling, form’d for happiness.</div>
      <div class='line'>His mother left him to his favourite ways,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what he made his pleasure brought him praise.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Romantic, tender, visionary, mild,</div>
      <div class='line'>Affectionate, reflecting when a child,      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With fear instinctive he from harshness fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gentle tears for all who suffer’d shed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Tales of misfortune touch’d his generous heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of maidens left, and lovers forced to part.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In spite of all that weak indulgence wrought,</div>
      <div class='line'>That love permitted, or that flattery taught;</div>
      <div class='line'>In spite of teachers who no fault would find,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Boy was neither selfish nor unkind.</div>
      <div class='line'>Justice and truth his honest heart approved,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all things lovely he admired and loved.      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Arabian Nights, and Persian Tales, he read,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his pure mind with brilliant wonders fed.</div>
      <div class='line'>The long Romances, wild Adventures fired</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>His stirring thoughts: he felt like Boy inspired.</div>
      <div class='line'>The cruel fight, the constant love, the art</div>
      <div class='line'>Of vile magicians, thrill’d his inmost heart:</div>
      <div class='line'>An early Quixote, dreaming dreadful sights</div>
      <div class='line'>Of warring dragons, and victorious knights—</div>
      <div class='line'>In every dream some beauteous Princess shone,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pride of thousands, and the prize of one.      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Not yet he read, nor, reading, would approve</div>
      <div class='line'>The Novel’s hero, or its ladies’ love.</div>
      <div class='line'>He would Sophia for a wanton take,</div>
      <div class='line'>Jones for a wicked, nay a vulgar rake.</div>
      <div class='line'>He would no time on Smollett’s page bestow;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such men he knew not, would disdain to know:</div>
      <div class='line'>And if he read, he travell’d slowly on,</div>
      <div class='line'>Teazed by the tame and faultless Grandison.</div>
      <div class='line'>He in that hero’s deeds could not delight—</div>
      <div class='line'>“He loved two ladies, and he would not fight.”      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The minor works of this prolific kind</div>
      <div class='line'>Presented beings he could never find:</div>
      <div class='line'>Beings, he thought, that no man should describe,</div>
      <div class='line'>A vile, intriguing, lying, perjured tribe,</div>
      <div class='line'>With impious habits, and dishonest views;</div>
      <div class='line'>The men he knew, had souls they feared to lose;</div>
      <div class='line'>These had no views that could their sins controul,</div>
      <div class='line'>With them nor fears nor hopes disturb’d the soul.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To dear Romance with fresh delight he turn’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And vicious men, like recreant cowards, spurn’d.      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line in2'>In those gay years, when boys their manhood prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because they talk of girls, and dream of love,</div>
      <div class='line'>In William’s way there came a maiden fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>With soft, meek look, and sweet, retiring air;</div>
      <div class='line'>With just the rosy tint upon her cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>With sparkling eye, and tongue unused to speak;</div>
      <div class='line'>With manner decent, quiet, chaste, that one,</div>
      <div class='line'>Modest himself, might love to look upon.</div>
      <div class='line'>As William look’d; and thus the gentle Squire</div>
      <div class='line'>Began the Nymph, albeit poor, t’admire.      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She was, to wit, the gardener’s niece; her place</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave to her care the Lady’s silks and lace;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>With other duties of an easy kind,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And left her time, as much she felt inclined,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>T’adorn her graceful form, and fill her craving mind;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, left her leisure to employ some hours</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the long day, among her uncle’s flowers—</div>
      <div class='line'>Myrtle and rose, of which she took the care,</div>
      <div class='line'>And was as sweet as pinks and lilies are.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such was the damsel whom our Youth beheld      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With passion unencouraged, unrepell’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>For how encourage what was not in view,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or how repel what strove not to pursue?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>What books inspired, or glowing fancy wrought;</div>
      <div class='line'>What dreams suggested, or reflection taught;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whate’er of love was to the mind convey’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>Was all directed to his darling maid.</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw his damsel with a lover’s eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>As pliant fancy wove the fair disguise;</div>
      <div class='line'>A Quixote he, who in his nymph could trace      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The high-born beauty, changed and—out of place,</div>
      <div class='line'>That William loved, mamma, with easy smile,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would jesting say; but love <i>might</i> grow the while;</div>
      <div class='line'>The damsel’s self, with unassuming pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>With love so led by fear was gratified.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>What cause for censure? Could a man reprove</div>
      <div class='line'>A child for fondness, or miscall it love?</div>
      <div class='line'>Not William’s self; yet well inform’d was he,</div>
      <div class='line'>That love it was, and endless love would be.</div>
      <div class='line'>Month after month the sweet delusion bred      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Wild, feverish hopes, that flourish’d, and then fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like Fanny’s sweetest flower—and that was lost</div>
      <div class='line'>In one cold hour, by one harsh morning frost.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In some soft evenings, mid the garden’s bloom,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would William wait, till Fanny chanced to come;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Fanny came, by chance it may be; still,</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a gentle bias of the will,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as the soundest minds may act upon,</div>
      <div class='line'>When motives of superior kind are gone.</div>
      <div class='line'>There then they met, and Master William’s look      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Was the less timid, for he held a book;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when the sweetness of the evening hours,</div>

      <div class='line'>The night-bird’s note, the gently falling dew,</div>

      <div class='line'>“The youth is faulty, but his faults are weigh’d</div>

      <div class='line'>If not, a father’s cares and troubles cease,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>The Will in hand, the Father musing stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then gravely answered, “Your advice is good;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet take the paper, and in safety keep;</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll make another Will before I sleep;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>The Friends then parted; this the Will possess’d,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>George, who was conscious that his Father grew</div>
      <div class='line'>Sick and infirm, engaged in nothing new.</div>
      <div class='line'>No letters came from injured man or maid;      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>No bills from wearied duns, that must be paid;</div>
      <div class='line'>No fierce reproaches from deserted fair,</div>

      <div class='line'>So hope rose softly in the parent’s breast;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He, dying, called his son and fondly blest,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line in2'>Unhappy Youth! e’er yet the tomb was closed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dust to dust convey’d in peace repos’d,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>And never saw it look so rich before.</div>
      <div class='line'>He viewed the dairy, view’d the men at plough,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With other eyes, with other feelings now,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And with a new-formed taste found beauty in a cow.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The distant swain who drove the plough along</div>

      <div class='line in2'>“Then here are cousins Susan, Robert, Joe—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'>To write this prose, that ought to be destroy’d!</div>
      <div class='line'>To no attorney would my father trust:</div>
      <div class='line'>He wished his son to judge of what was just;</div>
      <div class='line'>As if he said, ‘My boy will find the Will,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as he likes, destroy it or fulfil.’</div>
      <div class='line'>This now is reason, this I understand—</div>

      <div class='line'>As for this paper, with these cousiny names,</div>
      <div class='line'>I—’tis <i>my</i> Will—commit it to the flames.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hence! disappear! now am I lord alone:</div>
      <div class='line'>They’ll groan, I know; but, curse them, let them groan.</div>
      <div class='line'>Who wants his money like a new made heir,</div>
      <div class='line'>To put all things in order and repair?</div>
      <div class='line'>I need the whole the worthy man could save,</div>
      <div class='line'>To do my father credit in his grave:</div>

      <div class='line'>All this, attended by a world of cost,</div>
      <div class='line'>Requires, demands, that nothing should be lost.</div>

      <div class='line in2'>In triumph, yet in trouble, meets our Squire      <span class='linenum'>110}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The friends assembled, who a Will require.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“There is no Will,” he said.—They murmur and retire.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Days pass away, while yet the Heir is blest</div>
      <div class='line'>By pleasant cares, and thoughts that banish rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>When comes the Friend, and asks, in solemn tone,</div>
      <div class='line'>If he may see the busy Squire alone.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They are in private—all about is still—</div>
      <div class='line'>When thus the Guest:—“Your father left a Will,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I would see it.”—Rising in reply,</div>
      <div class='line'>The youth beheld a fix’d and piercing eye,      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>From which his own receded; and the sound</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his own words was in disorder drown’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>He answered softly—“I in vain have spent</div>
      <div class='line'>Days in the search; I pray you be content;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if a Will”—— The pertinacious Man,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>At ‘if’ displeased, with steady tone began—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“There <i>is</i> a Will—produce it, for you can.”—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Sir, I have sought in vain, and what the use?</div>
      <div class='line'>What has no being, how can I produce?”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Two days I give you; to my words attend,”      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Was the reply, “and let the business end.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Two days were past, and still the same reply</div>
      <div class='line'>To the same question—“Not a Will have I.”</div>
      <div class='line'>More grave, more earnest, then the Friend appear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>He spoke with power, as one who would be heard—</div>
      <div class='line'>“A Will your father made! I witness’d one.”</div>
      <div class='line'>The Heir arose in anger—“Sir, begone!</div>
      <div class='line'>Think you my spirit by your looks to awe?</div>
      <div class='line'>Go to your lodgings, friend, or to your law.</div>
      <div class='line'>To what would you our easy souls persuade?      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Once more I tell you, not a Will was made;</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s none with me, I swear it—now, deny</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>This if you can!”—</div>
      <div class='line in18'>“That, surely, cannot I;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, I believe you, and, as no such deed</div>
      <div class='line'>Is found with you, <i>this</i> surely will succeed!”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He said, and from his pocket slowly drew      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of the first testament a copy true,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And held it spread abroad, that he might see it too.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Read, and be sure; your parent’s pleasure see—</div>
      <div class='line'>Then leave this mansion and these lands to me.”      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>He said, and terror seized the guilty youth;</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw his misery, meanness, and the truth;</div>
      <div class='line'>Could not before his stern accuser stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet could not quit that hall, that park, that land;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, when surprise had pass’d away, his grief</div>
      <div class='line'>Began to think in law to find relief.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“While courts are open, why should I despair?</div>
      <div class='line'>Juries will feel for an abandon’d heir.</div>
      <div class='line'>I will resist,” he said, impell’d by pride—</div>
      <div class='line'>“I must submit,” recurring fear replied.      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As wheels the vane when winds around it play,</div>
      <div class='line'>So his strong passions turn’d him every way;</div>
      <div class='line'>But growing terrors seized th’ unhappy youth:</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew the Man, and more, he knew—the Truth;</div>
      <div class='line'>When, stung by all he fear’d, and all he felt,</div>
      <div class='line'>He sought for mercy, and in terror knelt.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Grieved, but indignant—“Let me not despise</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy father’s son,” replied the Friend; “arise!</div>
      <div class='line'>To my fix’d purpose your attention lend,</div>

      <div class='line'>In secret would—no mortal could—controul.      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, fool! to think that thou thy act could’st keep</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>From that All-piercing Eye, which cannot sleep!</div>

      <div class='line in2'><i>P.</i> Lives yet the Friend of that unhappy Boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who could the WILL that made him rich destroy,</div>
      <div class='line'>And made him poor? And what the after-plan,</div>
      <div class='line'>For one so selfish, of that stern, good man?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>F.</i> “Choose,” said this Friend, “thy way in life, and I <span class='linenum'>200 </span></div>
      <div class='line'>Will means to aid thee in thy work supply.”</div>
      <div class='line'>He will the army, thought this guardian, choose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there the sense of his dishonour lose.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Humbly he answer’d—“With your kind consent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of your estate I would a portion rent,</div>
      <div class='line'>And farm with care”——</div>
      <div class='line in18'>“Alas! the wretched fruit</div>
      <div class='line'>Of evil habit! he will hunt and shoot!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So judged the Friend, but soon perceived a change,</div>
      <div class='line'>To him important, and to all men strange.</div>
      <div class='line'>Industrious, temperate, with the sun he rose,      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And of his time gave little to repose:</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor to the labour only bent his will,</div>
      <div class='line'>But sought experience, and improved with skill;</div>
      <div class='line'>With cautious prudence placed his gains to use,</div>
      <div class='line'>Inquiring always, “What will this produce?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Friend, not long suspicious, now began</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>To think more kindly of the alter’d man—</div>
      <div class='line'>In his opinion alter’d; but, in truth,</div>
      <div class='line'>The same the spirit that still ruled the youth.</div>
      <div class='line'>That dwelt within, where other demons dwell,      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Avarice unsated and insatiable.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But this Wright saw not; he was more inclined</div>
      <div class='line'>To trace the way of a repenting mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he was now by strong disease assail’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>That quickly o’er the vital powers prevail’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>And now the son had all, was rich beyond</div>
      <div class='line'>His fondest hope, and he, indeed, was fond.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His life’s great care has been his zeal to prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>And time to dotage has increased his love.</div>
      <div class='line'>A Miser now, the one strong passion guides      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The heart and soul; there’s not a love besides.</div>
      <div class='line'>Where’er he comes, he sees in every face</div>
      <div class='line'>A look that tells him of his own disgrace.</div>
      <div class='line'>Men’s features vary, but the mildest show—</div>
      <div class='line'>“It is a tale of infamy we know.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Some with contempt the wealthy miser view,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some with disgust, yet mix’d with pity too;</div>
      <div class='line'>A part the looks of wrath and hatred wear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And some, less happy, lose their scorn in fear.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Meanwhile, devoid of kindness, comfort, friends,      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>On his possessions solely he depends.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet is he wretched; for his fate decrees</div>
      <div class='line'>That his own feelings should deny him ease.</div>
      <div class='line'>With talents gifted, he himself reproves,</div>
      <div class='line'>And can but scorn the vile pursuit he loves;</div>
      <div class='line'>He can but feel that there abides within</div>
      <div class='line'>The secret shame, the unrepented sin,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the strong sense, that bids him to confess</div>
      <div class='line'>He has not found the way to happiness.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But ’tis the way where he has travell’d long—      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And turn he will not, though he feels it wrong;</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a sad traveller, who, at closing day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Finds he has wander’d widely from his way,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet wanders on, nor will new paths explore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the night falls, and he can walk no more.</div>

      <div class='line'><i>P.</i> <span class='c023'>I</span> left a frugal Merchant, who began</div>
      <div class='line'>Early to thrive, and grew a wealthy man;</div>
      <div class='line'>Retired from business with a favourite Niece,</div>
      <div class='line'>He lived in plenty, or, if not—in peace.</div>
      <div class='line'>Their small affairs, conforming to his will,</div>
      <div class='line'>The maiden managed with superior skill.</div>
      <div class='line'>He had a Nephew too, a brother’s child—</div>
      <div class='line'>But James offended, for the lad was wild:</div>
      <div class='line'>And Patty’s tender soul was vex’d to hear,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Your Cousin James will rot in gaol, my dear;      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And now, I charge you, by no kind of gift</div>
      <div class='line'>Show him that folly may be help’d by thrift.”</div>
      <div class='line'>This Patty heard, but in her generous mind</div>
      <div class='line'>Precept so harsh could no admission find.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her Cousin James, too sure in prison laid,</div>
      <div class='line'>With strong petitions plied the gentle maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>That she would humbly on their Uncle press</div>
      <div class='line'>His deep repentance, and his sore distress;</div>
      <div class='line'>How that he mourn’d in durance, night and day,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, which removed, he would for ever pray.      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Nought will I give, his worthless life to save,”</div>
      <div class='line'>The Uncle said; and nought in fact he gave.</div>
      <div class='line'>But the kind maiden from her pittance took</div>
      <div class='line'>All that she could, and gave with pitying look;</div>
      <div class='line'>For soft compassion in her bosom reign’d,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>And her heart melted when the Youth complain’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his complaints the Uncle loved to hear,</div>
      <div class='line'>As Patty told them, shedding many a tear;</div>
      <div class='line'>While he would wonder how the girl could pray</div>
      <div class='line'>For a young rake, to place him in her way,      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or once admit him in his Uncle’s view;</div>
      <div class='line'>“But these,” said he, “are things that women do.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus were the Cousins, young, unguarded, fond,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bound in true friendship—so they named the bond—</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor call’d it love—and James resolved, when free,</div>
      <div class='line'>A most correct and frugal man to be.</div>
      <div class='line'>He sought her prayers, but not for heavenly aid:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Pray to my Uncle,” and she kindly pray’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>“James will be careful,” said the Niece; “and I</div>
      <div class='line'>Will be as careful,” was the stern reply.      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus he resisted, and I know not how</div>
      <div class='line'>He could be soften’d—Is he kinder now?</div>
      <div class='line'>Hard was his heart; but yet a heart of steel</div>
      <div class='line'>May melt in dying, and dissolving feel.</div>

      <div class='line'>He never married, that indeed we know,</div>

      <div class='line'>Perhaps his friends—for friends, as well as foes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will the infirmities of man disclose.      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>When young, our Merchant, though of sober fame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had a rude passion that he could not tame;</div>

      <div class='line'>He had a Son, who never had a wife;</div>
      <div class='line'>The father paid just what the law required,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor saw the infant, nor to see desired.</div>
      <div class='line'>That infant, thriving on the parish fare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without a parent’s love, consent, or care,</div>
      <div class='line'>Became a sailor, and sustain’d his part</div>
      <div class='line'>So like a man, it touch’d his father’s heart.—      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He for protection gave the ready pay,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>And placed the seaman in preferment’s way;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who doubted not, with sanguine heart, to rise,</div>

      <div class='line'>But Jack—for so we call’d him—Jack once more,</div>
      <div class='line'>And never after, touch’d his native shore;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor was it known if he in battle fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or sickening died—we sought, but none could tell.</div>
      <div class='line'>The father sigh’d—as some report, he wept;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then his sorrow with the Sailor slept;      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then age came on; he found his spirits droop,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his kind Niece remain’d the only hope.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Premising this, our story then proceeds—</div>
      <div class='line'>Our gentle Patty for her Cousin pleads;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now her Uncle, to his room confined,</div>

      <div class='line'>James, whom the law had from his prison sent,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With much contrition to his Uncle went,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, humbly kneeling, said, “Forgive me, I repent.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Reproach, of course, his humbled spirit bore;      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He knew for pardon anger opes the door;</div>
      <div class='line'>The man, whom we with too much warmth reprove,</div>
      <div class='line'>Has the best chance our softening hearts to move;</div>
      <div class='line'>And this he had—“Why, Patty, love! it seems,”</div>
      <div class='line'>Said the old man, “there’s something good in James;</div>
      <div class='line'>I must forgive; but you my child, are yet</div>
      <div class='line'>My stay and prop; I cannot this forget.</div>
      <div class='line'>Still, my dear Niece, as a reforming man,</div>
      <div class='line'>I mean to aid your Cousin, if I can.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Patty smiled; for James and she had now      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Time for their loves, and pledged the constant vow.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James the fair way to favouring thoughts discern’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>He learn’d the news, and told of all he learn’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Read all the papers in an easy style,</div>
      <div class='line'>And knew the bits would raise his Uncle’s smile;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then would refrain, to hear the good man say,</div>
      <div class='line'>“You did not come as usual yesterday;</div>
      <div class='line'>I must not take you from your duties, lad,</div>
      <div class='line'>But of your daily visits should be glad!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Patty was certain that their Uncle now      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Would their affection all it ask’d allow;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>She was convinced her lover now would find</div>
      <div class='line'>The past forgotten and old Uncle kind.</div>
      <div class='line'>“It matters not,” she added, “who receives</div>
      <div class='line'>The larger portion; what to one he leaves</div>
      <div class='line'>We both inherit! let us nothing hide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dear James, from him in whom we both confide.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Not for your life!” quoth James. “Let Uncle choose</div>
      <div class='line'>Our ways for us—or we the way shall lose.</div>
      <div class='line'>For know you, Cousin, all these miser men”——      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Nay, my dear James!”—</div>
      <div class='line in22'>“Our worthy Uncle, then,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all, like Uncle, like to be obey’d</div>
      <div class='line'>By their dependants, who must seem afraid</div>
      <div class='line'>Of their own will.—If we to wed incline,</div>
      <div class='line'>You’ll quickly hear him peevishly repine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Object, dispute, and sundry reasons give,</div>
      <div class='line'>To prove we ne’er could find the means to live;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then, due credit for his speech to gain,</div>
      <div class='line'>He’ll leave us poor—lest wealth should prove it vain.</div>
      <div class='line'>Let him propose the measure, and then we      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>May for his pleasure to his plan agree.</div>
      <div class='line'>I, when at last assenting, shall be still</div>
      <div class='line'>But giving way to a kind Uncle’s will;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then will he deem it just, amends to make</div>
      <div class='line'>To one who ventures all things for his sake;</div>
      <div class='line'>So, should you deign to take this worthless hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be sure, dear Patty, ’tis at his command!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But Patty questioned—“Is it, let me ask,</div>
      <div class='line'>The will of God that we should wear a mask?”</div>
      <div class='line'>This startled James: he lifted up his eyes,      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And said with some contempt, besides surprise,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Patty, my love! the will of God, ’tis plain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is that we live by what we can obtain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall we a weak and foolish man offend,</div>
      <div class='line'>And when our trial is so near our end?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This hurt the maiden, and she said, “’Tis well!</div>
      <div class='line'>Unask’d I will not of your purpose tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>But will not lie.”—</div>
      <div class='line in20'>“Lie! Patty, no, indeed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Your downright lying never will succeed!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>A better way our prudence may devise      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Than such unprofitable things as lies.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, a dependant, if he would not starve,</div>
      <div class='line'>The way through life must with discretion carve,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, though a lie he may with pride disdain,</div>
      <div class='line'>He must not every useless truth maintain.</div>
      <div class='line'>If one respect to these fond men would show,</div>
      <div class='line'>Conceal the facts that give them pain to know;</div>
      <div class='line'>While all that pleases may be placed in view,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if it be not, they will think it true.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The humble Patty dropp’d a silent tear,      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And said, “Indeed, ’tis best to be sincere.”</div>
      <div class='line'>James answer’d not—there could be no reply</div>
      <div class='line'>To what he would not grant nor could deny;</div>
      <div class='line'>But from that time he in the maiden saw</div>
      <div class='line'>What he condemn’d; yet James was kept in awe.</div>
      <div class='line'>He felt her virtue, but was sore afraid</div>
      <div class='line'>For the frank blunders of the virtuous maid.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Meantime he daily to his Uncle read</div>
      <div class='line'>The news, and to his favourite subjects led:</div>
      <div class='line'>If closely press’d, he sometimes staid to dine,      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Eat of one dish, and drank one glass of wine;</div>
      <div class='line'>For James was crafty grown, and felt his way</div>
      <div class='line'>To favour, step by step, and day by day;</div>
      <div class='line'>He talk’d of business, till the Uncle prized</div>
      <div class='line'>The lad’s opinion, whom he once despised,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, glad to see him thus his faults survive,</div>
      <div class='line'>“This Boy,” quoth he, “will keep our name alive.</div>
      <div class='line'>Women are weak, and Patty, though the best</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her weak sex, is woman like the rest:</div>
      <div class='line'>An idle husband will her money spend,      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And bring my hard-earn’d savings to an end.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Far as he dared, his Nephew this way led,</div>
      <div class='line'>And told his tales of lasses rashly wed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Told them as matters that “He heard, he knew</div>
      <div class='line'>Not where,” he said—“they might be false or true:</div>
      <div class='line'>One must confess that girls are apt to dote</div>
      <div class='line'>On the bright scarlet of a coxcomb’s coat;</div>
      <div class='line'>And that with ease a woman they beguile</div>
      <div class='line'>With a fool’s flattery, or a rascal’s smile;—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>But then,” he added, fearing to displease,      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Our Patty never saw such men as these.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“True! but she may—some scoundrel may command</div>
      <div class='line'>The girl’s whole store, if he can gain her hand.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her very goodness will itself deceive,</div>
      <div class='line'>And her weak virtue help her to believe;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet she is kind; and, Nephew! go, and say,</div>
      <div class='line'>I need her now—You’ll come another day.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In such discourses, while the maiden went</div>
      <div class='line'>About her household, many an hour was spent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till James was sure that when his Uncle died,      <span class='linenum'>190}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He should at least the property divide;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor long had he to wait—the fact was quickly tried.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Uncle now, to his last bed confined,</div>
      <div class='line'>To James and Patty his affairs resign’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>The doctor took his final fee in hand;</div>
      <div class='line'>The man of law received his last command;</div>
      <div class='line'>The silent priest sat watching in his chair,</div>
      <div class='line'>If he might wake the dying man to prayer—</div>
      <div class='line'>When the last groan was heard; then all was still,</div>
      <div class='line'>And James indulged his musings—on the Will.      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>This in due time was read, and Patty saw</div>
      <div class='line'>Her own dear Cousin made the heir-by-law.</div>
      <div class='line'>Something indeed was hers, but yet she felt</div>
      <div class='line'>As if her Uncle had not kindly dealt;</div>
      <div class='line'>And but that James was one whom she could trust,</div>
      <div class='line'>She would have thought it cruel and unjust.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ev’n as it was, it gave her some surprise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tears unbidden started in her eyes;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet she confess’d it was the same to her,</div>
      <div class='line'>And it was likely men would men prefer.      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Loth was the Niece to think her Uncle wrong;</div>
      <div class='line'>And other thoughts engaged her—“Is it long</div>
      <div class='line'>That custom bids us tarry ere we wed,</div>
      <div class='line'>When a kind Uncle is so lately dead?</div>
      <div class='line'>At any rate,” the maiden judged, “’tis he</div>
      <div class='line'>That first will speak—it does not rest with me.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James to the Will his every thought confined,</div>
      <div class='line'>And found some parts that vex’d his sober mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>He, getting much, to angry thoughts gave way,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>For the poor pittance that he had to pay,      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With Patty’s larger claim. Save these alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>The weeping heir beheld the whole his own;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet something painful in his mind would dwell—</div>
      <div class='line'>It was not likely, but was possible—”</div>
      <div class='line'>No—Fortune lately was to James so kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>He was determined not to think her blind:</div>
      <div class='line'>She saw his merit, and would never throw</div>
      <div class='line'>His prospects down by such malicious blow.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Patty, meanwhile, had quite enough betray’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her own mind to make her James afraid      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of one so simply pure: his hardening heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Inclined to anger—he resolved to part.</div>
      <div class='line'>Why marry Patty?—if he look’d around,</div>
      <div class='line'>More advantageous matches might be found;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, though he might a richer wife command,</div>
      <div class='line'>He first must break her hold upon his hand.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She with a spinster-friend retired awhile—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Not long,” she said—and said it with a smile.</div>
      <div class='line'>Not so had James determined.—He essay’d</div>
      <div class='line'>To move suspicion in the gentle maid.      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Words not succeeding, he design’d to pass</div>
      <div class='line'>The spinster’s window with some forward lass.</div>
      <div class='line'>If in her heart so pure no pang was known,</div>
      <div class='line'>At least he might affect it in his own.</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a brother of her friend, and he,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though poor and rude, might serve for jealousy.</div>
      <div class='line'>If all should fail, he, though of schemes bereft,</div>
      <div class='line'>Might leave her yet!—They fail’d, and she was left.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Poor Patty bore it with a woman’s mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with an angel’s, sorrowing and resign’d.      <span class='linenum'>250&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Ere this in secret long she wept and pray’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Long tried to think her lover but delay’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The union, once his hope, his prayer, his pride;—</div>
      <div class='line'>She could in James as in herself confide:</div>
      <div class='line'>Was he not bound by all that man can bind,</div>
      <div class='line'>In love, in honour, to be just and kind?</div>
      <div class='line'>Large was his debt, and, when their debts are large,</div>
      <div class='line'>The ungrateful cancel what the just discharge;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor payment only in their pride refuse,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>But first they wrong their friend, and then accuse.      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Thus Patty finds her bosom’s claims denied,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her love insulted, and her right defied.</div>
      <div class='line'>She urged it not; her claim the maid withdrew,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For maiden pride would not the wretch pursue;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>She sigh’d to find him false, herself so good and true.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now all his fears, at least the present, still—</div>
      <div class='line'>He talk’d, good man! about his uncle’s will—</div>
      <div class='line'>“All unexpected,” he declared—“surprised</div>
      <div class='line'>Was he—and his good uncle ill-advised.</div>
      <div class='line'>He no such luck had look’d for, he was sure,      <span class='linenum'>270&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor such deserved,” he said, with look demure;</div>
      <div class='line'>“He did not merit such exceeding love;</div>
      <div class='line'>But his, he meant, so help him God, to prove.”</div>
      <div class='line'>And he has proved it! all his cares and schemes</div>
      <div class='line'>Have proved the exceeding love James bears to James.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But to proceed—for we have yet the facts</div>
      <div class='line'>That show how Justice looks on wicked acts;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, though not always, she at times appears—</div>
      <div class='line'>To wake in man her salutary fears.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James, restless grown—for no such mind can rest—      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Would build a house, that should his wealth attest;</div>
      <div class='line'>In fact, he saw, in many a clouded face,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A certain token of his own disgrace,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And wish’d to overawe the murmurs of the place.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The finish’d building show’d the master’s wealth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And noisy workmen drank his Honour’s health—</div>
      <div class='line'>“His and his heirs”—and at the thoughtless word</div>
      <div class='line'>A strange commotion in his bosom stirr’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>“‘Heirs!’ said the idiots?”—and again that clause</div>
      <div class='line'>In the strange Will corrected their applause.      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Prophetic fears! for now reports arose</div>
      <div class='line'>That spoil’d “his Honour’s” comforts and repose.</div>
      <div class='line'>A stout young Sailor, though in battle maim’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Arrived in port, and his possessions claim’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Will he read: he stated his demand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his attorney grasp’d at house and land.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Will provided—“If my son survive,</div>
      <div class='line'>He shall inherit;” and lo! Jack’s alive!</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes! he was that lost lad, preserved by fate,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>And now was bent on finding his estate.      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But claim like this the angry James denied,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to the law the sturdy heir applied.</div>
      <div class='line'>James did what men when placed like him would do—</div>
      <div class='line'>Avow’d his right, and fee’d his lawyer too:</div>
      <div class='line'>The Will, indeed, provided for a son;</div>
      <div class='line'>But was this Sailor youth the very one?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ere Jack’s strong proofs in all their strength were shown,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To gain a part James used a milder tone;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But the instructed tar would reign alone.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>At last he reign’d: to James a large bequest      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Was frankly dealt; the Seaman had the rest—</div>
      <div class='line'>Save a like portion to the gentle Niece,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who lived in comfort, and regain’d her peace.</div>
      <div class='line'>In her neat room her talent she employ’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>With more true peace than ever James enjoy’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>The young, the aged, in her praise agreed—</div>
      <div class='line'>Meek in her manner, bounteous in her deed;</div>
      <div class='line'>The very children their respect avow’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>“’Twas the good lady,” they were told, and bow’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The merry Seaman much the maid approv’d—      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor that alone—he like a seaman loved;</div>
      <div class='line'>Loved as a man who did not much complain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Loved like a sailor, not a sighing swain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Had heard of wooing maids, but knew not how—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Lass, if you love me, prithee tell me now,”</div>
      <div class='line'>Was his address—but this was nothing cold—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Tell if you love me;” and she smiled and told.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He brought her presents, such as sailors buy,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Glittering like gold, to please a maiden’s eye,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>All silk and silver, fringe and finery;      <span class='linenum'>330}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>These she accepted in respect to him,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thought but little of the missing limb.</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this he told her, for he loved to tell</div>
      <div class='line'>A warlike tale, and judged he told it well:—</div>
      <div class='line'>“You mark me, love! the French were two to one,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so, you see, they were ashamed to run;</div>
      <div class='line'>We fought an hour; and then there came the shot</div>
      <div class='line'>That struck me here—a man must take his lot;—</div>
      <div class='line'>A minute after, and the Frenchman struck:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>One minute sooner had been better luck;      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But, if you can a crippled cousin like,</div>
      <div class='line'>You ne’er shall see him for a trifle strike.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Patty, whose gentle heart was not so nice</div>
      <div class='line'>As to reject the thought of loving twice,</div>
      <div class='line'>Judged her new Cousin was by nature kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>With no suspicions in his honest mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as our virtuous ladies now and then</div>
      <div class='line'>Find strongly floating in the minds of men.</div>
      <div class='line'>So they were married, and the lasses vow’d</div>
      <div class='line'>That Patty’s luck would make an angel proud:      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Not but that time would come when she must prove</div>
      <div class='line'>That men are men, no matter how they love!”—</div>
      <div class='line'>And she has prov’d it; for she finds her man</div>
      <div class='line'>As kind and true as when their loves began.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>James is unhappy; not that he is poor,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, having much, because he has no more;</div>
      <div class='line'>Because a rival’s pleasure gives him pain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Because his vices work’d their way in vain;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, more than these, because he sees the smile</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a wrong’d woman pitying man so vile.      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>He sought an office, serves in the excise,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And every wish, but that for wealth, denies;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Wealth is the world to him, and he is worldly wise.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But disappointment in his face appears;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Care and vexation, sad regret and fears      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Have fix’d on him their fangs, and done the work of years.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet grows he wealthy in a strange degree,</div>
      <div class='line'>And neighbours wonder how the fact can be.</div>
      <div class='line'>He lives alone, contracts a sordid air,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sees with sullen grief the cheerful pair;      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Feels a keen pang, as he beholds the door</div>
      <div class='line'>Where peace abides, and mutters—“<i>I am poor!</i>”</div>

      <div class='line'><i>P.</i> <span class='c023'>W</span>hat I have ask’d are questions that relate</div>
      <div class='line'>To those once known, that I might learn their fate.</div>
      <div class='line'>But there was <span class='sc'>One</span>, whom though I scarcely knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Much do I wish to learn his fortunes too.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet what expect?—He was a rich man’s Heir,</div>
      <div class='line'>His conduct doubtful, but his prospects fair;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thoughtless and brave, extravagant and gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wild as the wind, and open as the day;</div>
      <div class='line'>His freaks and follies were a thousand times</div>
      <div class='line'>Brought full in view; I heard not of his crimes.      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Like our Prince Hal, his company he chose</div>
      <div class='line'>Among the lawless, of restraint the foes;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, though to their poor pleasures he could stoop,</div>
      <div class='line'>He was not, rumour said, their victim-dupe.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His mother’s Sister was a maiden prim,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pious and poor, and much in debt to him.</div>
      <div class='line'>This she repaid with volumes of reproof,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sage advice, till he would cry “Enough!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His father’s Brother no such hints allow’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>Peevish and rich, and insolent and proud,      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of stern, strong spirit. Him the Youth withstood,</div>
      <div class='line'>At length; “Presume not” (said he) “on our blood!</div>
      <div class='line'>Treat with politeness him whom you advise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor think I fear your doting prophecies!”</div>
      <div class='line'>And fame has told of many an angry word,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>When anger this, and that contempt had stirr’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Boy! thou wilt beg thy bread, I plainly see.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Upbraid not, Uncle! till I beg of thee.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Oh! thou wilt run to ruin and disgrace.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“What! and so kind an Uncle in the place?”—      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Nay, for I hold thee stranger to my blood.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Then must I treat thee as a stranger would;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, if you throw the tie of blood aside,</div>
      <div class='line'>You must the roughness of your speech abide.”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“What! to your father’s Brother do you give</div>
      <div class='line'>A challenge?—Mercy! in what times we live!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now, I confess, the youth who could supply</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus that poor Spinster, and could thus defy</div>
      <div class='line'>This wealthy Uncle;—who could mix with them</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom his strong sense and feeling must condemn,      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And in their follies his amusement find,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet never lose the vigour of his mind—</div>
      <div class='line'>A youth like this, with much we must reprove,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had something still to win esteem and love.</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps he lives not; but he seem’d not made</div>
      <div class='line'>To pass through life entirely in the shade.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>F.</i> Suppose you saw him—does your mind retain</div>
      <div class='line'>So much, that you would know the man again?</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet hold in mind, he may have felt the press</div>
      <div class='line'>Of grief or guilt, the withering of distress;      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He now may show the stamp of woe and pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And nothing of his lively cast remain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Survey these features—see if nothing there</div>
      <div class='line'>May old impressions on your mind repair!</div>
      <div class='line'>Is there not something in this shattered frame</div>
      <div class='line'>Like to that—</div>
      <div class='line in10'><i>P.</i> No! not like it, but the same;</div>
      <div class='line'>That eye so brilliant, and that smile so gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are lighted up, and sparkle through decay.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But may I question? Will you that allow?</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a difference, and there must be now;      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And yet, permitted, I would gladly hear</div>
      <div class='line'>What must have pass’d in many a troubled year.</div>

      <div class='line'>Thy wanderings through, or sufferings in, the land;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, if our virtues cannot much produce,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps our errors may be found of use.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To all the wealth my Father’s care laid by,</div>
      <div class='line'>I added wings, and taught it how to fly.</div>
      <div class='line'>To him that act had been of grievous sight;      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But he survived not to behold the flight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Strange doth it seem to grave and sober minds,</div>
      <div class='line'>How the dear vice the simple votary blinds,</div>
      <div class='line'>So that he goes to ruin smoothly on,</div>
      <div class='line'>And scarcely feels he’s going, till he’s gone.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I had made over, in a lucky hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Funds for my Aunt, and placed beyond my power:</div>
      <div class='line'>The rest was flown, I speak it with remorse,</div>
      <div class='line'>And now a pistol seem’d a thing in course.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But, though its precepts I had not obey’d,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Thoughts of my Bible made me much afraid</div>
      <div class='line'>Of such rebellion, and, though not content,</div>
      <div class='line'>I must live on when life’s supports were spent;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, I must eat, and of my frugal Aunt</div>
      <div class='line'>Must grateful take what gracious she would grant;</div>
      <div class='line'>And true, she granted, but with much discourse—</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! with what words did she her sense enforce!</div>
      <div class='line'>Great was her wonder, in my need that I</div>
      <div class='line'>Should on the prop myself had raised rely—</div>
      <div class='line'>I, who provided for her in my care,      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Must be assured how little she could spare!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I stood confounded, and with angry tone,</div>
      <div class='line'>With rage and grief, that blended oath and groan,</div>
      <div class='line'>I fled her presence—yet I saw her air</div>
      <div class='line'>Of resignation, and I heard her prayer;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Now Heaven,” she utter’d, “make his burden light!”</div>
      <div class='line'>And I, in parting, cried, “Thou hypocrite!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But I was wrong—she might have meant to pray;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though not to give her soul—her cash—away.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of course, my Uncle would the spendthrift shun;      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So friends on earth I now could reckon none.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One morn I rambled, thinking of the past,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Far in the country—Did you ever fast</div>
      <div class='line'>Through a long summer’s day? or, sturdy, go</div>
      <div class='line'>To pluck the crab, the bramble, and the sloe,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hyp, the cornel, and the beech, the food</div>
      <div class='line'>And the wild solace of the gypsy brood?</div>
      <div class='line'>To pick the cress, embrown’d by summer sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the dry bed where streams no longer run?</div>
      <div class='line'>Have you, like school-boy, mingling play and toil,      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Dug for the ground-nut, and enjoy’d the spoil?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or chafed with feverish hand the ripening wheat,</div>
      <div class='line'>Resolved to fast, and yet compell’d to eat?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Say, did you this, and drink the crystal spring,</div>
      <div class='line'>And think yourself an abdicated king,</div>
      <div class='line'>Driv’n from your state by a rebellious race?</div>
      <div class='line'>And, in your pride contending with disgrace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could you your hunger in your anger lose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And call the ills you bear the ways you choose?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus, on myself depending, I began      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To feel the pride of a neglected man;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not yet correct, but still I could command</div>
      <div class='line'>Unshaken nerves, and a determined hand.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Lo! men at work!” I said, “and I, a man,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can work! I feel it is my pride, I can.”</div>
      <div class='line'>This said, I wander’d on, and join’d the poor,</div>
      <div class='line'>Assumed a labourer’s dress, and was no more</div>
      <div class='line'>Than labour made—Upon the road I broke</div>
      <div class='line'>Stones for my bread, and startled at the stroke;</div>
      <div class='line'>But every day the labour seem’d more light,      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And sounder, sweeter still the sleep of every night.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Thus will I live,” I cried, “nor more return</div>
      <div class='line'>To herd with men, whose love and hate I spurn.</div>
      <div class='line'>All creatures toil; the beast, if tamed or free,</div>
      <div class='line'>Must toil for daily sustenance like me;</div>
      <div class='line'>The feather’d people hunt as well as sing,</div>
      <div class='line'>And catch their flying food upon the wing.</div>
      <div class='line'>The fish, the insect, all who live, employ</div>
      <div class='line'>Their powers to keep on life, or to enjoy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their life th’ enjoyment; thus will I proceed,      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A man from man’s detested favours freed.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Thus was I reasoning, when at length there came</div>
      <div class='line'>A gift, a present, but without a name.</div>
      <div class='line'>“That Spinster-witch, has she then found a way</div>
      <div class='line'>To cure her conscience, and her Nephew pay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sends her pittance? Well, and let it buy</div>
      <div class='line'>What sweetens labour; need I this deny?</div>
      <div class='line'>I thank her not; it is as if I found</div>
      <div class='line'>The fairy-gift upon this stony ground.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Still I wrought on; again occurred the day,      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And then the same addition to my pay.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then, lo! another Friend, if not the same,</div>
      <div class='line'>For that I knew not, with a message came—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Canst keep accounts?” the man was pleased to ask—</div>
      <div class='line'>“I could not cash!—but that the harder task.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Yet try,” he said; and I was quickly brought</div>
      <div class='line'>To Lawyer Snell, and in his office taught.</div>
      <div class='line'>Not much my pay, but my desires were less,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I for evil days reserved th’ excess.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such day occurr’d not: quickly came there one,      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When I was told my present work was done.</div>
      <div class='line'>My Friend then brought me to a building large,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gave far weightier business to my charge.</div>
      <div class='line'>There I was told I had accounts to keep</div>
      <div class='line'>Of those vast Works, where wonders never sleep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where spindles, bobbins, rovings, threads, and pins,</div>
      <div class='line'>[Make] up the complex mass that ever spins.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There, at my desk, in my six feet of room,</div>
      <div class='line'>I noted every power of every loom;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sounds of all kinds I heard from mortal lungs—      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Eternal battle of unwearied tongues,</div>
      <div class='line'>The jar of men and women, girls and boys,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the huge Babel’s own dull whirring, grinding noise.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>My care was mark’d, and I had soon in charge</div>
      <div class='line'>Important matters, and my pay was large.</div>
      <div class='line'>I at my fortune marvell’d; it was strange,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so the outward and the inward change,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till to the Power who “gives and takes away”</div>
      <div class='line'>I turn’d in praise, and taught my soul to pray.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Another came! “I come,” he said, “to show,      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>Much I desired, and forth we rode, and found</div>
      <div class='line'>My Uncle dying, but his judgment sound.</div>
      <div class='line'>The good old man, whom I abused, had been</div>
      <div class='line'>The guardian power, directing but unseen;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus the wild but grateful boy he led</div>
      <div class='line'>To take new motives at his dying bed.</div>

have prevailed upon us to recommend his Labours to an Age
not extremely partial to poetical Composition.</p>

<p class='c026'>But, whatever Intimacy we may be favoured with in either
“Profound,” we are in this Case totally innocent of any Intention
to deceive thee; for, we apprehend, did the Genius
aforesaid think proper to add the Sin of Rhyme to his other
Failings, he has too great a Correspondence and Reputation
among Mankind to need our Solicitations in his Favour, were
we ever so well disposed to grant them; but, knowing of no
due Authority which any man hath to accuse Satan of this
Infirmity, we judge it both Cruel and unnecessary to load him
with so heavy a Charge, as would in all probability render him
more odious to Company in general than any other Accusation
he now labours under.</p>

<p class='c026'>We are however aware of this Objection, that, as the Devil
is “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab Origine</span></i>” the Author of Evil, so Poetry, as one Species of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>it, may properly be placed to his Account; but, as our argument
principally relates to the Piece before us, we shall waive all
general Discourse, and observe only that our Reasoning went
no farther than to show (whatever may be his Talent for
Poetry,) that we have no right to affix his Name in a particular
Manner to any one Publication.</p>

<p class='c026'>The very title of the Work we have thought proper to introduce
to our Acquaintance; for, besides that it is an Approved
Custom amongst Editors, we did not choose our honest and
venerated Name should appear to countenance a Falsity.</p>

<p class='c026'>As pure Compassion is our motive for recommending this
little Work to our learned Friends, so would we have its real
Author sensible of the Honour we do him, and not, with an
Author-like spirit, carp at our Emendations, at the Time we
are studiously aiming at his Benefit. Nor could we allow the
Title he has chosen to pass at any rate, did he not assure us he
can think of no other so likely to take with the humour of
the Town.</p>

<p class='c026'>It having occurred to us, that the judicious Authors of a
periodical Publication, called “The World,” did, in their first
Paper, counsel their Readers against being witty—purely for
the Wit’s sake—at their Expence, and more particularly did
guard them against such Expressions of pretended Disapprobation
as these, “’tis a vile World,” “a sad World,” &amp;c.: so,
gentle Friends, we would borrow a Thought from the excellent
Mr Fitz-Adam, and advise ye, not to abuse our Author with
the Terms “poor Devil,” “dull Devil,” “stupid Devil,” and
so forth, notwithstanding we do agree that it shall be imputed
unto ye for wit when ye shall say of the ensueing Poem, “it
is devilish good,” “devilish clever,” and such-like.</p>

<p class='c026'>And to all our Brethren, the real Critics and Judges of
Literary productions, we would towards that before us recommend
Lenity; it is a first performance and of a young
Author; and, albeit there shall be found blemishes and Failings
therein, we do in a certain Degree perceive Beauties not
altogether unworthy our Approbation, the which if ye likewise
behold, and point out to the Public after a friendly Sort, ye
shall do well.</p>

      <div class='line'>Joys are like oil: if thrown upon the tide</div>

      <div class='line in2'>But it was Misery stung me in the day</div>
      <div class='line'>Death of an infant sister made a prey;</div>
      <div class='line'>For then first met and moved my early fears,</div>

      <div class='line in2'><i>That</i> my first grief: but, oh! in after-years</div>

      <div class='line'>No! that I cannot, that I dare not, paint—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That patient sufferer, that enduring saint,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Holy and lovely—but all words are faint.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line in2'>Sweet was the morning’s breath, the inland tide,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And our boat gliding, where alone could glide      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Small craft—and they oft touch’d on either side.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It was my first-born joy. I heard them say,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Let the child go; he will enjoy the day.”</div>
      <div class='line'>For children ever feel delighted when</div>
      <div class='line'>They take their portion, and enjoy with men.</div>
      <div class='line'>Give him the pastime that the old partake,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he will quickly top and taw forsake.      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The linnet chirp’d upon the furze as well,</div>
      <div class='line'>To my young sense, as sings the nightingale.</div>
      <div class='line'>Without was paradise—because within</div>

      <div class='line'>I lost my way, and my companions me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all, their comforts and tranquillity.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mid-day it was, and, as the sun declined,</div>
      <div class='line'>The good, found early, I no more could find      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The men drank much, to whet the appetite;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, growing heavy, drank to make them light;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then drank to relish joy, then further to excite.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Their cheerfulness did but a moment last;</div>
      <div class='line'>Something fell short, or something overpast.</div>

      <div class='line'>Till “civil dudgeon” grew, and peace would smile no more.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'>The thunder burst, and rain came pattering down.</div>

      <div class='line'>’Twas not the morning’s quiet—it was not</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleasure revived, but Misery forgot;</div>
      <div class='line'>It was not Joy that now commenced her reign,</div>
      <div class='line'>But mere relief from wretchedness and Pain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So many a day, in life’s advance, I knew;</div>
      <div class='line'>So they commenced, and so they ended too.</div>
      <div class='line'>All Promise they—all Joy as they began!</div>
      <div class='line'>But Joy grew less, and vanish’d as they ran!</div>
      <div class='line'>Errors and evils came in many a form—</div>
      <div class='line'>The mind’s delusion, and the passions’ storm.      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The promised joy, that like this morning rose,</div>

      <div class='line'>E’en Love himself, that promiser of bliss,</div>
      <div class='line'>Made his best days of pleasure end like this:</div>
      <div class='line'>He mix’d his bitters in the cup of joy</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor gave a bliss uninjured by alloy.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>W</span>hen native Britons British lands possess’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>Their glory freedom, and their blessing rest—</div>
      <div class='line'>A powerful chief this lofty Seat survey’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And here his mansion’s strong foundation laid.</div>
      <div class='line'>In his own ground the massy stone he sought,</div>
      <div class='line'>From his own woods the rugged timbers brought,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rudeness and greatness in his work combined—</div>
      <div class='line'>An humble taste with an aspiring mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>His herds the vale, his flocks the hills, o’erspread;</div>
      <div class='line'>Warriors and vassals at his table fed;      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Sons, kindred, servants, waited on his will,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hail’d his mansion on the mighty hill.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In a new age a Saxon Lord appear’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And on the lofty base his dwelling rear’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then first the grand but threatening form was known,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to the subject-vale a Castle shown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where strength alone appear’d—the gloomy wall</div>
      <div class='line'>Enclosed the dark recess, the frowning hall;</div>
      <div class='line'>In chilling rooms the sudden fagot gleam’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>On the rude board the common banquet steam’d.      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Astonish’d peasants fear’d the dreadful skill</div>
      <div class='line'>That placed such wonders on their favourite hill;</div>
      <div class='line'>The soldier praised it as he march’d around,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the dark building o’er the valley frown’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A Norman Baron, in succeeding times,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here, while the minstrel sang heroic rhymes,</div>
      <div class='line'>In feudal pomp appear’d. It was his praise</div>
      <div class='line'>A loftier dome with happier skill to raise;</div>
      <div class='line'>His halls, still gloomy, yet with grandeur rose;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here friends were feasted—here confined were foes.      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In distant chambers, with her female train,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>Dwelt the fair partner of his awful reign.</div>
      <div class='line'>Curb’d by no laws, his vassal-tribe he sway’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lord commanded, and the slave obey’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>No soft’ning arts in those fierce times were found,</div>
      <div class='line'>But rival Barons spread their terrors round;</div>
      <div class='line'>Each, in the fortress of his power, secure,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of foes was fearless, and of soldiers sure;</div>
      <div class='line'>And here the chieftain, for his prowess praised,</div>
      <div class='line'>Long held the Castle that his might had raised.      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Came gentler times—the Barons ceased to strive</div>
      <div class='line'>With kingly power, yet felt their pomp survive;</div>
      <div class='line'>Impell’d by softening arts, by honour charm’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fair ladies studied and brave heroes arm’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lord of Belvoir then his Castle view’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Strong without form, and dignified but rude;</div>
      <div class='line'>The dark long passage, and the chambers small,</div>
      <div class='line'>Recess and secret hold, he banish’d all;</div>
      <div class='line'>Took the rude gloom and terror from the place,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bade it shine with majesty and grace.      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then arras first o’er rugged walls appear’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Bright lamps at eve the vast apartment cheer’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>In each superior room were polish’d floors,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tall ponderous beds, and vast cathedral doors.</div>
      <div class='line'>All was improved within, and then below</div>
      <div class='line'>Fruits of the hardier climes were taught to grow;</div>
      <div class='line'>The silver flagon on the table stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to the vassal left the horn and wood.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dress’d in his liveries, of his honours vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Came at the Baron’s call a menial train—      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Proud of their arms, his strength and their delight;</div>
      <div class='line'>Loud in the feast, and fearless in the fight.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then every eye the stately fabric drew</div>
      <div class='line'>To every part; for all were fair to view.</div>
      <div class='line'>The powerful chief the far-famed work descried,</div>
      <div class='line'>And heard the public voice that waked his pride.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleased he began—“About, above, below,</div>
      <div class='line'>What more can wealth command, or science show?</div>
      <div class='line'>Here taste and grandeur join with massy strength;</div>
      <div class='line'>Slow comes perfection, but it comes at length.      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Still must I grieve: these halls and towers sublime,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>Like vulgar domes, must feel the force of time;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when decay’d, can future days repair</div>
      <div class='line'>What I in these have made so strong and fair?</div>
      <div class='line'>My future heirs shall want of power deplore,</div>
      <div class='line'>When Time destroys what Time cannot restore.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sad in his glory, serious in his pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>At once the chief exulted and he sigh’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Dreaming he sigh’d, and still, in sleep profound,</div>
      <div class='line'>His thoughts were fix’d within the favourite bound:      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When lo! another Castle rose in view,</div>
      <div class='line'>That in an instant all his pride o’erthrew.</div>
      <div class='line'>In that he saw what massy strength bestows,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what from grace and lighter beauty flows—</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet all harmonious; what was light and free,</div>
      <div class='line'>Robb’d not the weightier parts of dignity;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor what was ponderous hid the work of grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>But all were just, and all in proper place.</div>
      <div class='line'>Terrace on terrace rose, and there was seen</div>
      <div class='line'>Adorn’d with flowery knolls the sloping green,      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Bounded by balmy shrubs from climes unknown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the nobler trees that grace our own.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Above, he saw a giant-tower ascend,</div>
      <div class='line'>That seem’d the neighbouring beauty to defend</div>
      <div class='line'>Of some light graceful dome—“And this,” he cried,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Awakes my pleasure, though it wounds my pride.”</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw apartments where appear’d to rise</div>
      <div class='line'>What seem’d as men, and fix’d on him their eyes—</div>
      <div class='line'>Pictures that spoke; and there were mirrors tall,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doubling each wonder by reflecting all.      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>He saw the genial board, the massy plate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grace unaffected, unencumber’d state;</div>
      <div class='line'>And something reach’d him of the social arts,</div>
      <div class='line'>That soften manners, and that conquer hearts.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Wrapt in amazement, as he gazed he saw</div>
      <div class='line'>A form of heav’nly kind, and bow’d in awe:</div>
      <div class='line'>The spirit view’d him with benignant grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And styled himself the Genius of the Place.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Gaze, and be glad!” he cried, “for this, indeed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is the fair Seat that shall to thine succeed,      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When these famed kingdoms shall as sisters be,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>And one great sovereign rule the powerful three.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then yon rich Vale, far stretching to the west,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beyond thy bound, shall be by <i>one</i> possess’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then shall true grace and dignity accord—</div>
      <div class='line'>With splendour, ease—the Castle with its Lord.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Baron waked—“It was,” he cried, “a view</div>
      <div class='line'>Lively as truth, and I will think it true.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some gentle spirit to my mind has brought</div>
      <div class='line'>Forms of fair works to be hereafter wrought;      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But yet of mine a part will then remain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor will that Lord its humbler worth disdain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Mix’d with his mightier pile shall mine be found,</div>
      <div class='line'>By him protected, and with his renown’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>He who its full destruction could command,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A part shall save from the destroying hand,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And say, ‘It long has stood—still honour’d let it stand!’”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>F</span>rom her own room, in summer’s softest eve,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stept <i>Celia</i> forth, her <i>Delia</i> to receive—</div>
      <div class='line'>Joy in her looks, that half her tale declared:</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> War and the waves my fav’rite Youth have spared;</div>
      <div class='line'>Faithful and fond, through many a painful year,</div>
      <div class='line'>My Charles will come——Do give me joy, my dear!</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>D.</i> I give you joy, and so may he; but still,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis right to question, if ’tis sure he will;</div>
      <div class='line'>A sailor’s open honest heart we prize;</div>
      <div class='line'>But honest sailors have their ears and eyes.      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> Oh! but he surely will on me depend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor dare to doubt the firmness of his friend.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>D.</i> Be not secure; the very best have foes,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And facts they would not to the world expose;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And these he may be told, if he converse with those.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> Speak you in friendship?—let it be sincere</div>
      <div class='line'>And naked truth—and what have I to fear?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>D.</i> I speak in friendship; and I do confess</div>
      <div class='line'>If I were you, the Truth should wear a dress:</div>
      <div class='line'>If Charles should doubt, as lovers do, though blind,      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Would you to him present the naked mind?</div>
      <div class='line'>If it were clear as crystal, yet it checks</div>
      <div class='line'>One’s joy to think that he may fancy specks;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now, in five long years, we scarcely know</div>
      <div class='line'>How the mind gets them, and how large they grow.</div>
      <div class='line'>Let woman be as rigid as a nun,</div>
      <div class='line'>She cannot censures and surmises shun.</div>
      <div class='line'>Wonder not, then, at tales that Scandal tells—</div>
      <div class='line'>Your father’s rooms were not like sisters’ cells;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor pious monks came there, nor prosing friars,      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But well-dress’d captains, and approving squires.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span><i>C.</i> What these to me, admit th’ account be true?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>D.</i> Nay, that yourself describe—they came to you!</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> Well! to my friend I may the truth confess,</div>
      <div class='line'>Poor Captain Glimmer loved me to excess;</div>
      <div class='line'>Flintham, the young solicitor, that wrote</div>
      <div class='line'>Those pretty verses, he began to dote;</div>
      <div class='line'>That Youth from Oxford, when I used to stop</div>
      <div class='line'>A moment with him, at my feet would drop;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor less your Brother, whom, for your dear sake,      <span class='linenum'>40}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>I to my favour often used to take—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And was, vile world! my character at stake?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>If such reports my Sailor’s ear should reach,</div>
      <div class='line'>What jealous thoughts and fancies may they teach;</div>
      <div class='line'>If without cause ill-judging men suspect,</div>
      <div class='line'>What may not all these harmless Truths effect?</div>
      <div class='line'>And what, my Delia, if our virtues fail,</div>
      <div class='line'>What must we fear if conscious we are frail?</div>
      <div class='line'>And well you know, my friend, nor fear t’ impart,</div>
      <div class='line'>The tender frailties of the yielding heart.      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>D.</i> Speak for yourself, fair lady! speak with care;</div>
      <div class='line'>I not your frailties, but your suffering, share.</div>
      <div class='line'>You may my counsel, if you will, refuse;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, pray, beware how you my name accuse!</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> Accuse you! No! there is no need of One,</div>
      <div class='line'>To do what long the public voice has done.</div>
      <div class='line'>What misses, then at school, forget the fall      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of Ensign Bloomer, when he leapt the wall?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That was a first exploit, and we were witness all;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And that sad night, upon my faithful breast,      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>We wept together, till we sank to rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>You own’d your love——</div>
      <div class='line in18'><i>D.</i> A girl, a chit, a child!</div>
      <div class='line'>Am I for this, and by a friend, reviled?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> Then lay your hand, fair creature! on your heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>And say how many there have had a part!</div>
      <div class='line'>Six I remember; and, if Fame be true,</div>
      <div class='line'>The handsome Serjeant had his portion too.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>D.</i> A Serjeant! Madam, if I might advise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Do use some small discretion in such lies!</div>
      <div class='line'>A Serjeant, Celia?——</div>
      <div class='line in18'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span><i>C.</i> Handsome, smart, and clean.      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yes! and the fellow had a noble mien,</div>
      <div class='line'>That might excuse you, had you giv’n your hand—</div>
      <div class='line'>But this your father could not understand.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>D.</i> Mercy! how pert and flippant are you grown,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if you’d not a secret of your own!</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet would you tremble, should your Sailor know</div>
      <div class='line'>What I, or my small cabinet, could show:</div>
      <div class='line'>He might suspect a heart with many a wound,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shallow and deep, could never more be sound;</div>
      <div class='line'>That of one pierced so oft, so largely bled,      <span class='linenum'>80}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The feeling ceases, and the love is dead;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But sense exists, and passion serves instead.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> Injurious Delia! cold, reproachful maid!</div>
      <div class='line'>Is thus my confidential faith repaid?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is this the counsel that we two have held,</div>
      <div class='line'>When duty trembled, and desire rebell’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>The sister-vows we made, through many a night,</div>
      <div class='line'>To aid each other in the arduous fight</div>
      <div class='line'>With the harsh-minded powers who never think</div>
      <div class='line'>What nature needs, nor will at weakness wink?      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And now, thou cruel girl! is all forgot,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The wish oft whisper’d, the imagined lot,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The secret Hymen, the sequester’d cot?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And will you thus our bond of friendship rend,</div>
      <div class='line'>And join the world in censure of your friend?</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! ’tis not right! as all with scorn must see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Although the certain mischief falls on me.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>D.</i> Nay, never weep! but let this kiss restore</div>
      <div class='line'>And make our friendship perfect as before;</div>
      <div class='line'>Do not our wiser selves ourselves condemn,      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And yet we dearly love their faults and them?</div>
      <div class='line'>So our reproofs to tender minds are shown:</div>
      <div class='line'>We treat their wanderings as we treat our own;</div>
      <div class='line'>We are each other’s conscience, and we tell</div>
      <div class='line'>Our friend her fault, because we wish her well;</div>
      <div class='line'>We judge, nay prejudge, what may be her case,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fore-arm the soul, and shield her from disgrace.</div>
      <div class='line'>Creatures in prison, ere the trying day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their answers practise, and their powers essay.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>By means like these they guard against surprise,      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And all the puzzling questions that may rise.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Guilty or not?” His lawyer thus address’d</div>
      <div class='line'>A wealthy rogue—“Not guilty, I protest.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Why, then, my friend, we’ve nothing here to say,</div>
      <div class='line'>But you’re in danger! prithee heed your way!</div>
      <div class='line'><i>You</i> know your truth, <i>I</i> where your error lies:</div>
      <div class='line'>From your ‘<i>Not</i> guilty’ will your danger rise.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Oh! but I <i>am</i>, and I have here the gain</div>
      <div class='line'>Of wicked craft”—“Then let it <i>here</i> remain;</div>
      <div class='line'>For we must guard it by a sure defence,      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And not professions of your innocence;</div>
      <div class='line'>For that’s the way, whatever you suppose,</div>
      <div class='line'>To slip your neck within the ready noose.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus, my beloved friend, a girl, if wise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon her Prudence, not her Truth, relies;</div>
      <div class='line'>It is confess’d, that not the good and pure</div>
      <div class='line'>Are in this world of calumny secure—</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore never let a lass rely</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon her goodness and her chastity!</div>
      <div class='line'>Her very virtue makes her heedless: youth      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Reveals imprudent, nay injurious, truth;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whereas, if conscious that she merit blame,</div>
      <div class='line'>She grows discreet, and well defends her fame,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus, offending, better makes her way—</div>
      <div class='line'>As Joseph Surface argues in the play—</div>
      <div class='line'>Than when in virtue’s strength she proudly stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>So wrongly right, and so absurdly good.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now, when your Charles shall be your judge, and try      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His own dear damsel—questioning how and why—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Let her be ready, arm’d with prompt reply;      <span class='linenum'>140}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>No hesitation let the man discern,</div>
      <div class='line'>But answer boldly, then accuse in turn:</div>
      <div class='line'>Some trifling points with candid speech confess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>You gain a monstrous credit for the rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then may you wear the Injured Lady frown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with your anger keep his malice down;</div>
      <div class='line'>Accuse, condemn, and make him glad at heart</div>
      <div class='line'>To sue for pardon, when you come to part.</div>
      <div class='line'>But let him have it; let him go in peace,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>And all inquiries of themselves will cease;      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To touch him nearer, and to hold him fast,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have a few tears <i>in petto</i> at the last—</div>
      <div class='line'>But this with care! for ’tis a point of doubt,</div>
      <div class='line'>If you should end with weeping or without.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis true you much affect him by your pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>But he may want to prove his power again;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, then, it spoils the look, and hurts the eyes—</div>
      <div class='line'>A girl is never handsome when she cries.</div>
      <div class='line'>Take it for granted, in a general way,</div>
      <div class='line'>The more you weep for men, the more you may.      <span class='linenum'>160&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Save your resources; for, though now you cry</div>
      <div class='line'>With good effect, you may not by and by.</div>
      <div class='line'>It is a knack; and there are those that weep</div>
      <div class='line'>Without emotion, that a man may sleep;</div>
      <div class='line'>Others disgust—’tis genius, not advice,</div>
      <div class='line'>That will avail us in a thing so nice.</div>
      <div class='line'>If you should love him, you have greater need</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all your care, and may not then succeed.</div>
      <div class='line'>For that’s our bane—we should be conquerors all</div>
      <div class='line'>With hearts untouch’d—our feelings cause our fall.      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But your experience aids you: you can hide</div>
      <div class='line'>Your real weakness in your borrow’d pride.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But to the point—should so the Charge be laid,</div>
      <div class='line'>That nought against it fairly can be said—</div>
      <div class='line'>How would you act? You would not then confess?—</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> Oh! never! no!—nor even my Truth profess!</div>
      <div class='line'>To mute contempt I would alone resort</div>
      <div class='line'>For the Reporters, and for their Report.</div>
      <div class='line'>If he profess’d forgiveness, I would cry—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Forgive such faithlessness! so would not I!      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Such errors pardon! he that so would act</div>
      <div class='line'>Would, I am sure, be guilty of the fact.</div>
      <div class='line'>Charles, if I thought your spirit was so mean,</div>
      <div class='line'>I would not longer in your walks be seen;</div>
      <div class='line'>Could you such woman for a moment prize?</div>
      <div class='line'>You might forgive her, but you must despise.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>D.</i> Bravo, my girl! ’tis then our sex command,</div>
      <div class='line'>When we can seize the weapon in their hand;</div>
      <div class='line'>When we their charge so manage, that ’tis found</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>To save the credit it was meant to wound.      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Those who by reasons their acquittal seek,</div>
      <div class='line'>Make the whole sex contemptible and weak;</div>
      <div class='line'>This, too, observe—that men of sense in love</div>
      <div class='line'>Dupes more complete than fools and blockheads prove;</div>
      <div class='line'>For all that knowledge lent them as a guide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Goes off entirely to the lady’s side;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whereas the blockhead rather sees the more,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gains perception that he lack’d before.</div>
      <div class='line'>His honest passion blinds the man of sense.</div>
      <div class='line'>While want of feeling is the fool’s defence;      <span class='linenum'>200&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Arm’d with insensibility he comes;</div>
      <div class='line'>When more repell’d, he but the more assumes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus succeeds where fails the man of wit;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, where we cannot conquer, we submit.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But come, my love! let us examine now,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>These Charges all—say, what shall we avow,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Admit, deny; and which defend, and how?      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That old affair between your friend and you,</div>
      <div class='line'>When your fond Sailor bade his home adieu,</div>
      <div class='line'>May be forgotten; yet we should prepare      <span class='linenum'>210&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For all events—and are you guarded there?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> Oh! ’tis long since—I might the whole deny—</div>
      <div class='line'>“So poor, and so contemptible a lie!</div>
      <div class='line'>Charles, if ’tis pleasant to abuse your friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let there be something that she may defend;</div>
      <div class='line'>This is too silly—”</div>
      <div class='line in16'><i>D.</i> Well you may appear</div>
      <div class='line'>With so much spirit—not a witness near;</div>
      <div class='line'>Time puzzles judgment; and, when none explain,</div>
      <div class='line'>You may assume the airs of high disdain.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, for my Brother—night and morn were you      <span class='linenum'>220&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Together found, th’ inseparable two,</div>
      <div class='line'>Far from the haunts of vulgar prying men—</div>
      <div class='line'>In the old abbey—in the lonely glen—</div>
      <div class='line'>In the beech-wood—within the quarry made</div>
      <div class='line'>By hands long dead—within the silent glade,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the moon gleams upon the spring that flows</div>
      <div class='line'>By the grey willows as they stand in rows—</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall I proceed? there’s not a quiet spot</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>In all the parish where the pair were not</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft watch’d, oft seen. You must not so despise      <span class='linenum'>230&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>This weighty charge—Now, what will you devise?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> “Her brother! What, Sir? jealous of a child!</div>
      <div class='line'>A friend’s relation! Why, the man is wild—</div>
      <div class='line'>A boy not yet at college! Come, this proves</div>
      <div class='line'>Some truth in you! This is a freak of Love’s:</div>
      <div class='line'>I must forgive it, though I know not how</div>
      <div class='line'>A thing so very simple to allow.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pray, if I meet my cousin’s little boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>And take a kiss, would that your peace annoy?</div>
      <div class='line'>But I remember Delia—yet, to give      <span class='linenum'>240&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A thought to this is folly, as I live—</div>
      <div class='line'>But I remember Delia made her prayer</div>
      <div class='line'>That I would try and give the Boy an air;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet awkward he, for all the pains we took—</div>
      <div class='line'>A bookish boy, his pleasure is his book;</div>
      <div class='line'>And since the lad is grown to man’s estate,</div>
      <div class='line'>We never speak—Your bookish youth I hate.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>D.</i> Right! and he cannot tell, with all his art,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our father’s will compelled you both to part.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> Nay, this is needless—</div>
      <div class='line in33'><i>D.</i> Oh! when you are tried, <span class='linenum'>250 </span></div>
      <div class='line'>And taught for trial, must I feed your pride?</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! that’s the vice of which I still complain:</div>
      <div class='line'>Men could not triumph were not women vain.</div>
      <div class='line'>But now proceed—say <i>boyhood</i> in this case</div>
      <div class='line'>(The last obscure one) shields you from disgrace.</div>
      <div class='line'>But what of Shelley? all your foes can prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all your friends, that here indeed was love.</div>
      <div class='line'>For three long months you met as lovers meet,</div>
      <div class='line'>And half the town has seen him at your feet;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, on the evil day that saw you part,      <span class='linenum'>260&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Your ashy looks betray’d your aching heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>With this against you——</div>
      <div class='line in23'><i>C.</i> This, my watchful friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Confess I cannot, therefore must defend.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Shelley! dear Charles, how enter’d he your mind?</div>
      <div class='line'>Well may they say that jealousy is blind!</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the men who talk’d with me of love,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>His were the offers I could least approve;</div>
      <div class='line'>My father’s choice—and, Charles, you must agree      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That my good father seldom thinks with me—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or his had been the grief, while thou wert tost at sea!      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It was so odious—when that man was near,      <span class='linenum'>271&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>My father never could himself appear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Had I received his fav’rite with a frown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon my word he would have knock’d me down.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>D.</i> Well! grant you durst not frown—but people say</div>
      <div class='line'>That you were dying when he went away.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes! you were ill! of that no doubts remain;</div>
      <div class='line'>And how explain it?—</div>
      <div class='line in19'><i>C.</i> Oh! I’ll soon explain.</div>
      <div class='line'>“I sicken’d, say you, when the man was gone—</div>
      <div class='line'>Could I be well, if sickness would come on?      <span class='linenum'>280&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Fact follows fact; but is ‘t of Nature’s laws</div>
      <div class='line'>That one of course must be the other’s cause?</div>
      <div class='line'>Just as her husband tried his fav’rite gun,</div>
      <div class='line'>My cousin brought him forth his first-born son—</div>
      <div class='line'>The birth might either flash or fright succeed,</div>
      <div class='line'>But neither, sure, were causes of the deed.</div>
      <div class='line'>That Shelley left us, it is very true—</div>
      <div class='line'>That sickness found me, I confess it too;</div>
      <div class='line'>But that the one was cause, and one effect,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is a conceit I utterly reject.      <span class='linenum'>290&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>You may, my Friend, demonstrate, if you please,</div>
      <div class='line'>That disappointment will bring on disease;</div>
      <div class='line'>But, if it should, I would be glad to know</div>
      <div class='line'>If ’tis a quinsy that such griefs bestow?</div>
      <div class='line'>A heart may suffer, if a lady doat;</div>
      <div class='line'>But will she feel her anguish in the throat?</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve heard of pangs that tender folks endure,</div>
      <div class='line'>But not that linctuses and blisters cure.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>Your thoughts, my Delia?</div>
      <div class='line in23'><i>D.</i> What I think of this?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why! if he smile, it is not much amiss.      <span class='linenum'>300&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But there are humours; and, by them possess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>A lover will not hearken to a jest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Well, let this pass!—but, for the next affair,</div>
      <div class='line'>We know your father was indignant there:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>He hated Miller. Say! if Charles should press</div>
      <div class='line'>For explanation, what would you confess?</div>
      <div class='line'>You cannot there on his commands presume;</div>
      <div class='line'>Besides, you fainted in a public room;</div>
      <div class='line'>There own’d your flame, and, like heroic maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sovereign impulse of your will obey’d.      <span class='linenum'>310&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>What, to your thinking, was the world’s disdain?</div>
      <div class='line'>You could retort its insolence again.</div>
      <div class='line'>Your boundless passion boldly you avow’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And spoke the purpose of your soul aloud;</div>
      <div class='line'>Associates, servants, friends, alike can prove</div>
      <div class='line'>The world-defying force of Celia’s love.</div>
      <div class='line'>Did she not wish, nay vow, to poison her</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom, some durst whisper, Damon could prefer?</div>
      <div class='line'>And then that frantic quarrel at the ball—</div>
      <div class='line'>It must be known, and he will hear it all.      <span class='linenum'>320&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nay! never frown, but cast about, in time,</div>
      <div class='line'>How best to answer what he thinks a crime;</div>
      <div class='line'>For what he thinks might have but little weight,</div>
      <div class='line'>If you could answer—</div>
      <div class='line in19'><i>C.</i> Then I’ll answer straight—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not without Truth; for who would vainly tell</div>
      <div class='line'>A wretched lie, when Truth might serve as well?</div>
      <div class='line'>Had I not Fever? is not that the bane</div>
      <div class='line'>Of human wisdom? was I not insane?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Oh! Charles, no more! would you recall the day</div>
      <div class='line'>When it pleased Fate to take my wits away?      <span class='linenum'>330&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>How can I answer for a thousand things</div>
      <div class='line'>That this disorder to the sufferer brings?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is it not known, the men whom you dislike</div>
      <div class='line'>Are those who now the erring fancy strike?</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor would it much surprise me, if ’twere true,</div>
      <div class='line'>That in those days of dread I slighted you.</div>
      <div class='line'>When the poor mind, illumined by no spark</div>
      <div class='line'>Of reason’s light, was wandering in the dark,</div>
      <div class='line'>You must not wonder, if the vilest train</div>
      <div class='line'>Of evil thoughts were printed on the brain;      <span class='linenum'>340&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor, if the loyal and the faithful prove</div>
      <div class='line'>False to their king, and faithless to their love.”—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>Your thoughts on this?</div>
      <div class='line in21'><i>D.</i> With some you may succeed</div>
      <div class='line'>By such bold strokes; but they must love indeed.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>C.</i> Doubt you his passion?—</div>
      <div class='line in34'><i>D.</i> But in five long years</div>
      <div class='line'>The passion settles—then the reason clears.</div>
      <div class='line'>Turbid is love, and to ferment inclined,</div>
      <div class='line'>But by and by grows sober and refined,</div>
      <div class='line'>And peers for facts; but, if one can’t rely</div>
      <div class='line'>On truth, one takes one’s chance—you can but try.      <span class='linenum'>350&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet once again I must attention ask</div>
      <div class='line'>To a new Charge, and then resign my task.</div>
      <div class='line'>I would not hurt you; but confess at least</div>
      <div class='line'>That you were partial to that handsome Priest;</div>
      <div class='line'>Say what they will of his religious mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>He was warm-hearted, and to ladies kind.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now, with his reverence you were daily seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>When it was winter and the weather keen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Traced to the mountains when the winds were strong,</div>
      <div class='line'>And roughly bore you, arm in arm, along—      <span class='linenum'>360&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That wintry wind, inspired by love or zeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>You were too faithful or too fond to feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shielded from inward and from outward harm</div>
      <div class='line'>By the strong spirit, and the fleshly arm—</div>
      <div class='line'>The winter-garden you could both admire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And leave his sisters at the parlour fire;</div>
      <div class='line'>You trusted not your speech these dames among—</div>
      <div class='line'>Better the teeth should chatter, than the tongue!</div>
      <div class='line'>Did not your father stop the pure delight</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this perambulating Love at night?      <span class='linenum'>370&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It is reported, that his craft contrived</div>

      <div class='line'>At this new tale, then, what will be your cheer?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I hear,” says he—and he will look as grim</div>

      <div class='line'>Your mind is gross, and you have dwelt so long</div>

      <div class='line'>Ladies who owed their freedom to his might</div>

      <div class='line in2'>The brood of giants, famous in those times,</div>

      <div class='line'>Colbrand the strong, who by the Dane was brought,      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line in2'>But what to Guy were men, or great or small,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or one or many?—he despatch’d them all;</div>
      <div class='line'>A huge dun Cow, the dread of all around,</div>
      <div class='line'>A master-spirit in our hero found:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas desolation all about her den—</div>
      <div class='line'>Her sport was murder, and her meals were men.</div>
      <div class='line'>At Dunmore Heath the monster he assail’d,      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er the fiercest of his foes prevail’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nor fear’d he lions more than lions fear</div>

      <div class='line'>A fiery dragon, whether green or red</div>
      <div class='line'>The story tells not, by his valour bled;</div>
      <div class='line'>What more I know not, but by these ’tis plain</div>
      <div class='line'>That Guy of Warwick never fought in vain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When much of life in martial deeds was spent,</div>
      <div class='line'>His sovereign lady found her heart relent,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gave her hand. Then all was joy around,      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And valiant Guy with love and glory crown’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Warwick Castle wide its gate display’d,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Alas! not long—a hero knows not rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>A new sensation fill’d his anxious breast.</div>
      <div class='line'>His fancy brought before his eyes a train</div>
      <div class='line'>Of pensive shades, the ghosts of mortals slain;</div>
      <div class='line'>His dreams presented what his sword had done;</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw the blood from wounded soldiers run,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dying men, with every ghastly wound,      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Breathed forth their souls upon the sanguine ground.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Alarm’d at this, he dared no longer stay,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But left his bride, and as a pilgrim gray,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With staff and beads, went forth to weep and fast and pray.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In vain his Felice sigh’d—nay, smiled in vain;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With all he loved he [dared] not long remain,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But roved he knew not where, nor said, “I come again.”      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>The widow’d countess pass’d her years in grief,</div>
      <div class='line'>But sought in alms and holy deeds relief;</div>
      <div class='line'>And many a pilgrim ask’d, with many a sigh,      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To give her tidings of the wandering Guy.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>Perverse and cruel! could it conscience ease,</div>

      <div class='line'>And, like a quiet man, repent at home?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How different those who now this seat possess!</div>
      <div class='line'>No idle dreams disturb their happiness.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lord who now presides o’er Warwick’s towers</div>
      <div class='line'>To nobler purpose dedicates his powers;</div>
      <div class='line'>No deeds of horror fill his soul with fear,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Nor conscience drives him from a home so dear.</div>
      <div class='line'>The lovely Felice of the present day</div>
      <div class='line'>Dreads not her lord should from her presence stray;</div>
      <div class='line'>He feels the charm that binds him to a seat</div>
      <div class='line'>Where love and honour, joy and duty, meet.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But forty days could Guy his fair afford;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not forty years would weary Warwick’s lord.</div>
      <div class='line'>He better knows, how charms like hers control</div>
      <div class='line'>All vagrant thoughts, and fill with her the soul;</div>
      <div class='line'>He better knows, that not on mortal strife,      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Or deeds of blood, depend the bliss of life—</div>
      <div class='line'>But on the ties that first the heart enchain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every grace that bids the charm remain.</div>
      <div class='line'>Time will, we know, to beauty work despite,</div>
      <div class='line'>And youthful bloom will take with him its flight;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Love shall still subsist, and, undecay’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Feel not one change of all that Time has made.</div>

      <div class='line'>Him she would wed, but was not so refin’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Or so romantic as to wed his Mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>She had been told, that her admiring Swain</div>

      <div class='line'>This Man and Wife had nature well allied;</div>
      <div class='line'>For both were positive, and both had pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the Love that in the bosom glow’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Was on the person tenderly bestow’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>As weeds, cut down and burn’d upon the field,      <span class='linenum'>520&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To their own place their little value yield.</div>
      <div class='line'>Both lov’d a Life expensive, but they still</div>

      <div class='line'>And she from knowledge of the Cost refrain’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>They were not wealthy, and they needed Care</div>

      <div class='line'>In this good Lady it was strange to see</div>

      <div class='line'>Learning she held, if not a very Crime,      <span class='linenum'>530&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A needless burden and a Loss of Time.</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the world above and this below</div>

      <div class='line'>She play’d at Whist with such surprising Skill,      <span class='linenum'>540&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That many censur’d her for playing ill;</div>
      <div class='line'>But this was error; she disdain’d to cheat,</div>

      <div class='line'>Beside, she felt a Scruple to the Deed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Except in Times of the extremest Need.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Rebells she scorn’d, and wish’d, with all her Soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Ropes might choak whom Laws could not controul,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a Staunch Patriot was to her a word</div>
      <div class='line'>For factious wretches, impious and absurd.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet to the Cause she lov’d with so much Zeal      <span class='linenum'>550&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>She could no more than Approbation deal,</div>

      <div class='line'>Her Self for shewing what was just and right.</div>
      <div class='line'>She kept her Church, and often would exclaim</div>

      <div class='line'>And give Example to the lower Class!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She heard of Battles, where ten thousand fell,      <span class='linenum'>560&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And beg’d that none would on the Subject dwell:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Such Wounds and Carnage, fire, blood, and Smoke!</div>
      <div class='line'>Good God! it poison’d every Meal she took!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Active and able to contend, she still      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Found in her Lord a Stubbornness of Will;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A dull resisting Strength, that baffled all her Skill;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A <i>Vis inertiæ</i>—and, in fact, no stone</div>
      <div class='line'>Could be more stubborn to be wrought upon—</div>
      <div class='line'>A Mind at rest, that she could neither please      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>By any Effort, nor by any teize;      <span class='linenum'>570}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A Soul envelop’d deep in intellectual Ease—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But this not always; favourite points to gain,</div>
      <div class='line'>He would a Warfare valiantly maintain;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then her Prudence taught the Dame to yield,</div>
      <div class='line'>That she with double strength might take the field;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when victorious in some grand affair,</div>
      <div class='line'>She [yielded] others as beneath her Care.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The first-born Child had every dawning Grace</div>
      <div class='line'>And promis’d Beauty in her form and face.</div>
      <div class='line'>“We’ll call her Julie, if you please, my dear,”      <span class='linenum'>580&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The Mother cry’d, “I doat on Julie Vere.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“What! no Remembrance of her Aunt! for shame!</div>
      <div class='line'>You doat indeed! be Barbara her name!”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Oh! never, never”—and a storm began</div>
      <div class='line'>That quite o’erpower’d the Spirit of the Man.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Babe was Julie, nor a Word was heard</div>
      <div class='line'>That spoke his Wishes to have interfer’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Succeeding Daughters came with feeble Cry</div>
      <div class='line'>Who caus’d few Cares, and only liv’d to die;</div>
      <div class='line'>But ten years past, when, to the Father’s Joy      <span class='linenum'>590&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And Mother’s Glory, she produc’d a Boy.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now said the Lady, “If you would consent</div>
      <div class='line'>To call him Frederick, I should be content.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Be [sure],” he answer’d with a Sneer, “my Love,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll give the Boy a Name you must approve:</div>
      <div class='line'>He shall be Julian!” “An heroic Name</div>
      <div class='line'>Of some old fool!” said the indignant Dame.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Fool!” said the Husband; “nay, a glorious Prince;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor have Mankind beheld his equal since.</div>
      <div class='line'>He the whole World from Superstition free’d,      <span class='linenum'>600&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A[nd] left the Bigots neither Cross nor Creed.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Well,” said the Wife, with infinite Disdain,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Could not the Bigots get a Creed again?</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>And ’tis your Maxim that all Crimes are bred</div>
      <div class='line'>By Men with new Opinions in their Head;</div>
      <div class='line'>Was it not foolish in your Prince to force</div>
      <div class='line'>These quiet Bigots from their antient Course?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Nay, you mistake; he wanted to restore</div>
      <div class='line'>Things as they had been in the Times of yore.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“What!” quoth the Lady; “both a foe and friend      <span class='linenum'>610&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To Superstition! this can you defend?</div>
      <div class='line'>I knew him not; but I suppose, if known,</div>
      <div class='line'>He wish’d his people’s folly like his own;</div>
      <div class='line'>He whom he could of his Religion made,</div>
      <div class='line'>And punish’d those whom he could not persuade.—</div>
      <div class='line'>But let your favourite Prince his name afford;</div>
      <div class='line'>I will not quarrel with you for a Word.”</div>
      <div class='line'>The Name she thought would not ungraceful be,</div>
      <div class='line'>And nothing knew of the Apostacy.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Priest objected, but the Squire maintain’d      <span class='linenum'>620&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The Point with Vigor, and his purpose gain’d.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus liv’d the Couple, daily to contend,</div>
      <div class='line'>And never wish’d their Quarrels at an End.</div>
      <div class='line'>They felt no fondness, and no more of hate</div>
      <div class='line'>Than gave an Edge and pleasure to debate.</div>
      <div class='line'>Contentions sprang from themes of every kind</div>
      <div class='line'>And wak’d from Sloth to Energy the Mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Quarrels they took, like Bitters, to excite</div>
      <div class='line'>And give Exertion to the Appetite.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For twice ten years the sprightly Course they try’d;      <span class='linenum'>630&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>When the Strife ended, and the Husband died.</div>
      <div class='line'>But first he thought that she who had been long</div>
      <div class='line'>A Plague to him would lead his Julian wrong;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor would she fail to soothe and to decoy</div>
      <div class='line'>To her own Will th’affection of the boy.</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore a Friend and Neighbour he besought</div>
      <div class='line'>That no such Evil on the Child be wrought;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, tho’ the friend was Christian, all was well.</div>
      <div class='line'>This rather pleas’d the dying Infidel;</div>
      <div class='line'>For he confess’d he had among them seen,      <span class='linenum'>640&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As spake their Actions, some with Conscience clean;</div>
      <div class='line'>And not Philosophers themselves were found</div>
      <div class='line'>Above all seeming and within all sound.</div>
      <div class='line'>Julian was thus in purest knowledge train’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>In all the Father slighted or disdain’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>Honour to value at the noblest price;</div>
      <div class='line'>To hold no parly with a pleading Vice;</div>
      <div class='line'>And true Religion to defend in Times</div>
      <div class='line'>When Truth and faith were heresies and Crimes.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Man whom Vere judg’d fittest to protect      <span class='linenum'>650&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His Boy, when young, and into Life direct</div>
      <div class='line'>Was one who made of Talents no display:      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>A mild good Man, of whom his friends could say      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That Foes in vain might blame the Lord of Etheringay—      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The “virtuous Boyle,” a Name that he sustain’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And well preserv’d the fame that others gain’d.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>He with a widow’d Father past his Time</div>

      <div class='line'>Young as he was, he found himself too old</div>
      <div class='line'>This youthful beauty coolly to behold.</div>
      <div class='line'>Domestics idly talk’d of future Tyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Julian’s Mother of her new Allies.</div>
      <div class='line'>She pleas’d her boy by praises of his choice,</div>

      <div class='line'>The Influence that his Sex and age must gain;</div>

      <div class='line'>For him to look to what he had to trust.</div>
      <div class='line'>His Father left him with involv’d Affairs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who had no Mercy on his Wife and Heirs;</div>
      <div class='line'>He must take heed to what he was about,</div>

      <div class='line'>His Person, Mind, Connection, and Degree</div>
      <div class='line'>Might win a wealthier Maid than Emely;      <span class='linenum'>690&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But still, as providence had seem’d to knit</div>
      <div class='line'>The destin’d knot, she deem’d it right and fit,</div>
      <div class='line'>And charged him, on her blessing, well to play</div>
      <div class='line'>His Cards, and never throw his Luck away!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Young as he was, the Boy was not at ease.</div>
      <div class='line'>He now had Motives [and] designs to please;</div>

      <div class='line'>Something unpleasant in his Guardian’s face.</div>
      <div class='line'>He now had thoughts that he could not express,</div>

      <div class='line'>When with his Mother Tracy chanc’d to come,</div>

      <div class='line'>He had no Love, no Hate, nor Fear nor Hope,</div>
      <div class='line'>But gave [his] Humour and his passions Scope;</div>
      <div class='line'>And oft, when Julian warn’d the nymph to shun</div>
      <div class='line'>The Rain and Cold, the Shadow and the Sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her favourite Cecil to the roughest Play</div>
      <div class='line'>Would call, and quarrel if she dar’d delay.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet she perversely from the Kindness fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>And follow’d Cecil wheresoe’er he led;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor had the Garden or the Lawn a spot</div>

      <div class='line'>When the griev’d Wife and antient Parent shed</div>
      <div class='line'>Their Tears of envying Anguish o’er the Dead.</div>
      <div class='line'>They saw before them but a length of Woes,</div>

      <div class='line'>But the fair Child, their pity and their pride,</div>

      <div class='line'>Till they some transient fits of Pleasure caught      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, first forbidding, next received them sought.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Seldom the Boys their fairy Mistress met;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>The good old Man, to Heav’n’s will resign’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>With Faith and Hope sustain’d his modest Mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>Time and Reflection had their sure Success,</div>
      <div class='line'>And soft’ned Sorrow rose from deep distress.</div>
      <div class='line'>To this Religion added thoughts that force</div>

      <div class='line'>Hope stronger still before the Image cast</div>
      <div class='line'>A veil oblivious, to conceal the past;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then on the future threw so bright a ray</div>
      <div class='line'>That Sorrow smil’d in Tears and softly died away.</div>

      <div class='line'>When he look’d back upon the Days serene</div>
      <div class='line'>That he and Susan had together seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>[Ere] this free Soldier his fair Maid address’d</div>
      <div class='line'>And broke with Dreams of Bliss the [wonted] rest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet had he past the Sign, nor turn’d again</div>
      <div class='line'>For Speech insulting nor for threat’ning vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had not the Youth, contemptuous, from the Inn</div>
      <div class='line'>Reach’d him, resolv’d a Quarrel to begin:      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“Come, stay, my Hero, and determine now</div>

      <div class='line'>Win her and wear her; fight for or decline;</div>
      <div class='line'>Begin the battle, or the Bride is mine!”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Coxcomb!” said Joseph; and by force he free’d</div>
      <div class='line'>His captive Arm and hasten’d to proceed.</div>
      <div class='line'>“‘Coxcomb!’” said Francis; “you shall quickly know</div>

      <div class='line'>“A Ring! a Ring!” for now a gathering Crowd</div>
      <div class='line'>Had vulgar and tumultuous Joy avow’d.      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“If the Great Cesar had presum’d to Call,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>And [on] the Instant, as he ceas’d to speak,</div>

      <div class='line'>On all the glorious Science of the fist,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor wanted Courage for the noble Strife,</div>
      <div class='line'>And would have fought for Glory or a Wife.      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Here too he saw a Foe who could not boast</div>
      <div class='line'>Of more than Courage and plain strength at most;</div>
      <div class='line'>“And this,” said he, “the Maiden’s Heart must gain:</div>
      <div class='line'>Success and Courage never plead in vain.”</div>
      <div class='line'>With open palm he struck, and hasten’d then</div>
      <div class='line'>To the warm Conflict of experienc’d Men;</div>
      <div class='line'>For he was train’d in both the useful Arts</div>

      <div class='line'>But, urg’d by Insult of the grossest kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>He gave to Vengeance and to War his Mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew his Rival’s Strength, his boasted art,</div>

      <div class='line'>He wanted Skill, he car’d not for Applause;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he had Courage and the better Cause.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There was one friend of Joseph, one indeed</div>
      <div class='line'>Almost unknown and now a friend in need,      <span class='linenum'>170&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With whom nor Time nor Cash he deign’d to spend—</div>
      <div class='line'>The Landlord of the Bell was Joseph’s friend.</div>
      <div class='line'>But why this Love? for Francis was in Truth,</div>

      <div class='line'>And all he spent, as all the Green could tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save short Excursions, all was at the Bell.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, when the Landlord would at Night repair</div>
      <div class='line'>To the fair Wife and to the favourite Chair,</div>

      <div class='line'>And from such Trifle—strange as it appears—</div>
      <div class='line'>Harry was harried by an Husband’s fears.</div>
      <div class='line'>He wish’d that Joseph by some lucky blow</div>
      <div class='line'>Might lay the Hero of the people low;</div>
      <div class='line'>It would have pleas’d him to have told his Wife</div>

      <div class='line'>Or that inspired the sweetest Look,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or kindly in the features spoke.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Possessed of Fancies vain and proud</div>
      <div class='line'>I spurned the male and female Crowd,</div>

      <div class='line'>In some May Morn, in some green Bower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where I should soothe my dream of Grief,</div>
      <div class='line'>To meet the Lady of the Leaf;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her Love and Favour to implore</div>
      <div class='line'>And be her Knight for evermore.      <span class='linenum'>40&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But let me raise my Style, and tell</div>
      <div class='line'>What in my Vision me befell.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“One day I mus’d beside a Wood,</div>
      <div class='line'>As I had often done before,</div>
      <div class='line'>And [seemed] so rich and brave and good</div>
      <div class='line'>As never Man was made before.</div>
      <div class='line'>A green Inclosure was beside,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, not far distant on the Hill,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>A noble Seat, our County’s Pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Built with abundant Care and Skill;      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And thence had issued Ladies fair</div>
      <div class='line'>And walked within the Place below,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the green Wood conceal’d the pair</div>
      <div class='line'>From me, who walking felt the Glow</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the Vanity and pride</div>
      <div class='line'>That push’d the intruding World aside.</div>
      <div class='line'>And now, while thus enwrap’d and fed</div>
      <div class='line'>With thoughts that self indulgence bred,</div>
      <div class='line'>I heard a Shriek so long and loud</div>
      <div class='line'>That prov’d the Shriekers were not proud,      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But would accept the meanest Aid</div>
      <div class='line'>That ever succour’d folk afraid.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“For so it was: that pair divine</div>
      <div class='line'>Were met by some rebellious Kine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who, in their stubborn Pride and Scorn,</div>
      <div class='line'>With surly Hoof and threat’ning Horn</div>
      <div class='line'>Usurp’d the Path, and, as the Maids</div>
      <div class='line'>Drew near, and [would have] sought its Shades,</div>
      <div class='line'>[Ere] they could reach the guarding Wood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some surly Beast their Way withstood.      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And hence the dismal Shriek that drew</div>
      <div class='line'>My Eyes, and asked my Action too;</div>
      <div class='line'>As Justness prompted, forth I ran</div>
      <div class='line'>Resolv’d to show myself a Man;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, plucking forth an oaken Bough,</div>
      <div class='line'>I ran like Guy to fight the Cow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, like a valiant Champion, fixed</div>
      <div class='line'>Myself the Maids and Cows betwixt.</div>
      <div class='line'>And, tho’ I had not breath to say,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Run, Ladies, for the Stile away!’      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Yet doubtless, with a warlike Grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>My hand was pointed to the Place.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“The Ladies took me at my Word,</div>
      <div class='line'>And each flew lightly like a Bird.</div>
      <div class='line'>I now had time my thoughts t’ arrange</div>
      <div class='line'>And should have liked my place to change;</div>
      <div class='line'>For now the Creatures seemed disposed</div>
      <div class='line'>For Battle, and in Order closed;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, tho’ they halted, yet I found</div>
      <div class='line'>My feet upon precarious Ground;      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And yet, to turn me and retreat</div>
      <div class='line'>Was not alone to own Defeat,</div>
      <div class='line'>But to invite th’ encouraged Foe</div>
      <div class='line'>To fell pursuit and overthrow.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“The Ladies, who had pass’d the Stile,</div>
      <div class='line'>Looked on impatiently the while;</div>
      <div class='line'>And were amazed, for so they said,</div>
      <div class='line'>To see the horrid Cows afraid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And kept in coward fear by one</div>
      <div class='line'>Who had for them such Service done.      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Which had the Victory, Man or Cow,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>Can never be determined now.</div>
      <div class='line'>For lo! some amazons appear’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Resolv’d to milk the stubborn Herd;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who, as they now obedient grew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Left me my purpose to pursue—</div>
      <div class='line'>A purpose that I could not well</div>
      <div class='line'>Distinguish, nor can fairly tell.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“The [quicker] Nymph with gracious Smile</div>
      <div class='line'>Received me safe beyond the Stile;      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Where I had time to feast my Eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>On paradise and prodigies—</div>
      <div class='line'>Charms, such as Nature once creates,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then breaks the Mould (the Lover states).</div>
      <div class='line'>But this, dear Joseph, was a Face</div>
      <div class='line'>I could not from my fancy chase,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was more than I had dreamed, was more      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Than Fancy drew for me before,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And bade me my own Work adore.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But let me not on Beauty dwell:      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>So should we feel—at least ’tis my Belief—</div>

      <div class='line'>They go to War like us, their Queens and Kings—</div>

      <div class='line'>Westward, a Range of lofty Hills is seen;</div>
      <div class='line'>A Farm’s large Lands and Mansion lie between—</div>
      <div class='line'>A lonely Mansion. From the nearest Town</div>
      <div class='line'>The Evening Bell comes faintly floating down;</div>

      <div class='line'>The fallen Billow strikes the listless Ear.      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Before the Mansion, and extended wide,</div>

      <div class='line'>Why in these Scenes of Solitude delight?</div>
      <div class='line'>It may be soothing, but cannot be right.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus spake the Squire; for he was vext to find      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His Sister sad; for all he meant was kind.</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Pensive and silent, passive in her Woe,</div>
      <div class='line'>She went with him, though indisposed to go;</div>
      <div class='line'>And to the loud Reproof and threat’ning tone</div>
      <div class='line'>She school’d her Heart, and said, “I’ll grieve alone.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When near their Home, again the Brother cried:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Come let thy Griefs be still, thine Eyes be dried!</div>

      <div class='line'>That we might wonder whence arose it all;</div>
      <div class='line'>With Borough-Business of such high Concern,</div>
      <div class='line'>That poor Matilda was compell’d to learn</div>
      <div class='line'>What Honours fell upon their Heads, and how</div>
      <div class='line'>The worthy Burgess took the Member’s Bow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And how returned, and what a joyous Look</div>
      <div class='line'>His face discover’d, when their hands they shook.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Brother, grieving for the patient Grief</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the fair Mourner, strove for her Relief;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, finding Wrath disturbed her gentle Breast,      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In gentler Tone his Love and Care exprest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“’Tis now five Years, and this about the day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since the Bellair was wreckt in Liddel-Bay;</div>
      <div class='line'>When Fredrick came a Sufferer to our Home,</div>
      <div class='line'>As for our Sins destroying Angels come.</div>
      <div class='line'>He came alone, in Misery, to our Care;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then fled the Home and left the Misery there.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Nay, Sister, be not thus to Anguish wrought;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>“All seemed so fair: he no Pretences made,      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Was poor, and owned it—that could not persuade;</div>
      <div class='line'>His Temper gay, his Mind without a Cloud,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of Honour and his Country justly proud.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>No Fear, no Mask—this all must be allow’d;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And yet, he left us.—Sister, I must go,</div>
      <div class='line'>To seek this Angel-Dæmon, Friend and Foe.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The gentle Mourner for a while appeared</div>
      <div class='line'>Absorbed in thought; her Brother’s Words she feared,</div>
      <div class='line'>His Love she owned; she thanked him from her Soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>But begged he would these angry thoughts controul.      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“You must not meet,” she said, with deep-drawn Sigh</div>
      <div class='line'>And flowing Tears—“you must not, nor must I.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There was a Pause; but Richard could not hide</div>
      <div class='line'>The rising Anger or the wounded Pride.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Ask me not, Sister, while Your Wrong is mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>To bear a Blow and like a Dog to whine!</div>
      <div class='line'>But, if I could my Sense of Wrong subdue,</div>
      <div class='line'>I must revenge an Insult offered you.</div>
      <div class='line'>Let him for all account, for all repent,</div>
      <div class='line'>For all atone; and then I may relent.      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Him I must seek; for never Man of Sense</div>
      <div class='line'>Can live in all this horrible Suspense.</div>
      <div class='line'>Him must I seek.”—</div>
      <div class='line in16'>“Nay Richard, Brother, Friend!</div>
      <div class='line'>Grieve not thy Sister, whom thou wouldst defend!</div>
      <div class='line'>War not with Death or Sorrow; what I crave</div>
      <div class='line'>Is Peace on Earth. O war not with the Grave!</div>
      <div class='line'>Let all that Death can touch untroubled lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>And who would strive with that which cannot die!”—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Is he no more?”—</div>
      <div class='line in16'>“’Tis painful to reply.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>To us he is; and let the Subject die!      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For, if he lives, he suffers, and he feels</div>
      <div class='line'>The Pangs that Death concludes—at least conceals.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I know not this; or, grant repentance true,</div>
      <div class='line'>I still am wronged[, and] Vengeance is my due.</div>
      <div class='line'>You may forgive your Husband, if you can;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I must wreak my Vengeance on the Man.</div>
      <div class='line'>You had refused him; but for my Request</div>
      <div class='line'>That thought disturbs me. Hence I cannot rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>True, he was handsome; all that Women love</div>
      <div class='line'>In Air and Manner, all that Men approve      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In Sense and Courage; yet, before he fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>The better Spirit of the Man was dead.</div>
      <div class='line'>You saw he grieved and moped alone about;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Date of Virtue, Love and Peace was out;</div>
      <div class='line'>He for a Man of Worth awhile was known,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then the Devil came to claim his own.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“No more, my Brother! I must now prepare</div>
      <div class='line'>The one sad Secret of my Soul to share;</div>
      <div class='line'>To make my mystic Fortune understood,</div>
      <div class='line'>And keep thee free from peril and from blood.—      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>But I must bind thee, Richard; thou must keep</div>
      <div class='line'>The Peace, and let thy strong Resentment sleep!”</div>
      <div class='line'>He gave Assent.</div>
      <div class='line in14'>“To know my present State,</div>
      <div class='line'>I must a Portion of the past relate.</div>
      <div class='line'>Remember you, before my Fred’rick’s flight,</div>

      <div class='line'>You laught at this—”</div>
      <div class='line in18'>“’Tis true; for I supposed</div>
      <div class='line'>The Man was hypped, and Wine and Mirth proposed;</div>
      <div class='line'>For I had some Misgiving, and could trace</div>
      <div class='line'>The Marks that Mystics term the Signs of Grace.      <span class='linenum'>150&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Then, was it so? Alas! ere yet he fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>I saw that something in his Mind had bred.</div>
      <div class='line'>But yet I spoke not, thinking every Day</div>
      <div class='line'>Life’s common Cares would wear the gloom away;</div>
      <div class='line'>Indeed, I jested; for your Husband’s Style</div>
      <div class='line'>And his sad look would often cause a smile.</div>
      <div class='line'>But now proceed!”—</div>
      <div class='line in16'>“You recollect the Praise</div>
      <div class='line'>You gave that Spirit in our early Days.</div>
      <div class='line'>From a light Heart we said those Spirits rise;</div>

      <div class='line'>That Mirth arises from the Soul’s Content,</div>

      <div class='line'>But oh, my Brother! I had Cause to fear      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That all within that Heart did not appear;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Frank as he ever seemed, he was not now sincere.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>His Sleep was troubled; in the solemn Night</div>
      <div class='line'>He woke in Terror and demanded Light.</div>
      <div class='line'>He then some Guilt with fearful Haste Avow’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bade his Silent Wife not speak so loud.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>Yet was he cautious, and his Words were weighed      <span class='linenum'>170}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>With fretful Care, like One who seems afraid      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>By his own speech his Crime should be betrayed.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Temperate before, he now would often fly      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To Wine for Aid, that treacherous Ally      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That undermines the Strength it should supply;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That, like to Money borrowed in Distress,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seems to increase our Power, but makes it less.—</div>
      <div class='line'>All this I saw, not hopeless; I believed</div>
      <div class='line'>A Man, awakened, for his Error grieved;</div>
      <div class='line'>His seemed to me the Salutary Storm      <span class='linenum'>180&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That shakes the Soul it will at Length reform.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I spoke in Love and Pity, ‘Let us Pray!’</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherefore he cried, and turned Alarmed away.</div>
      <div class='line'>This I had known: the new Awaken’d hide</div>
      <div class='line'>Their Fears from Man—it is false Nature’s Pride—</div>
      <div class='line'>But Hope still whispered, ‘Ease will follow Pain;</div>

      <div class='line'>Nor knew I yet there was the Part unsound;</div>
      <div class='line'>Untouched, unseen, the ever rankling Wound!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Yet more distressed he grew; and then I cried,      <span class='linenum'>190&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>‘Go to the Priest and take him for thy Guide!’</div>
      <div class='line'>But Frederick’s Grief was not the transient Rage</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Clouds that Winds collect and Rains asswage;</div>
      <div class='line'>But still more Dark the mental Prospect grew,</div>

      <div class='line'>What Sin had purchased, that with him remained.</div>

      <div class='line'>A meek good priest; he had in part confest      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'>A look of Suffering, he was cool no more.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then would he say, “My Sister, you are ill,</div>

      <div class='line'>Who goes in Search of Health may be supplied</div>
      <div class='line'>In Every Way he travels with a Guide.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One of these Guides, long taught the way to please</div>

      <div class='line in2'>This was not said, but something not so rude—</div>
      <div class='line'>And this was meant, and this was understood.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Against Advice the placid Mother strove;</div>
      <div class='line'>She fought with Learning, but complied with Love.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Coast of France appear’d new Strength to give</div>

      <div class='line'>See what is seen; enjoy what is enjoyed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And through the Coast must at her Pleasure ride,      <span class='linenum'>440&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And never think!” for so advised the Guide.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Now where, Matilda, shall we go to-day?”</div>
      <div class='line'>So Richard said, as he was wont to say;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Where bend our Steps?” He took his Glass in Hand:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Here comes a Boat; suppose we see it land?”</div>
      <div class='line'>They saw it land—“And, Boatmen, who are these?”—</div>
      <div class='line'>“A Priest they say, and from beyond the Seas.</div>
      <div class='line'>But he who leans upon the Friend beside</div>

      <div class='line'>Coming for Health; and, if he means to stay      <span class='linenum'>450&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Till it arrives, he’ll never go away.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So spake the Seamen; when, approaching nigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>Matilda stopt and, with an heavy sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dropt on the Shore. Her Brother, frightened, flew</div>
      <div class='line'>To give her Aid—she breathed, and, “Is it true?”</div>
      <div class='line'>She said; “I saw him—I my Frederick see;</div>
      <div class='line'>Brother, forgive! he comes to die with me.</div>
      <div class='line'>What Heaven decrees is done.”—And now began</div>

      <div class='line in2'>He spoke of Years that fled, while thus employed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Dangers conquered and of Health destroyed;</div>
      <div class='line'>“And then,” he said, “I felt my Heart incline</div>

      <div class='line'>These and the Scenes of many a pleasant Thought</div>
      <div class='line'>Were from that Distance to their fancy brought;      <span class='linenum'>520&ensp;</span></div>

<div class='lg-container-l c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='c023'>I</span> left my Friend, and at the Closing day</div>
      <div class='line'>Took to the Church-Yard walk my evening way.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas there, invited by th’unusual Sound,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Good old Sexton in the Church I found;</div>
      <div class='line'>He from a Vault had thrown the Earth aside—</div>
      <div class='line'>Proof that some Person of Respect had died;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now was coming to that vaulted Home</div>
      <div class='line'>To which—but not in Churches—we must come.</div>
      <div class='line'>There the old Sexton, on the Heap he made,</div>
      <div class='line'>Looked at his Work and leaned upon his Spade;      <span class='linenum'>10&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>As if with some Complacency he dwelt</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon his Task and its Importance felt.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Stranger,” said Good-man Sexton—I was strange</div>
      <div class='line'>To my old Neighbour—“here’s an awful change!”</div>
      <div class='line'>This provoked Question; Question to such Man</div>
      <div class='line'>Provoked Reply; and thus his Tale began.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“In yonder Place—for so our People call</div>
      <div class='line'>That large new House; the other is the Hall;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis the more Antient—yet, for many a Year,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Squire and his Forefathers flourished here.      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Long had the last with his good Lady kept</div>
      <div class='line'>Their Wedding-vow, together walked and slept,</div>
      <div class='line'>And were a loving, grave, Church-going Pair;</div>
      <div class='line'>Howbeit, Heaven vouchsafed them not an Heir.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But Oh! the sad Events of Mortal Life!</div>
      <div class='line'>The Squire in ripe old age forgot his Wife;</div>
      <div class='line'>Forgot the Sayings of the Law divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And took an Harlot for his Concubine.</div>
      <div class='line'>From thence, O stranger! we may date his Fall;</div>
      <div class='line'>In fact it was the Ruin of them all.      <span class='linenum'>30&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>For my good Lady grieved to think how Sin</div>
      <div class='line'>His Heart, by Prayer unguarded, entered in;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, though the Squire observed the Sabbath Day,</div>
      <div class='line'>It was forsooth to shew the Poor the Way.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas not to have his Conscience clean and swept;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, though he listened for a while, he slept.—</div>
      <div class='line'>But, not to tarry in the tale I tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>He sought not Grace to stand; and so he fell.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Some two Years since, he walked his Fields to see;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Saw them at Distance, and his Mind was free;      <span class='linenum'>40}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Approaching near, a bounden slave was he.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Like the rich Boaz, he his People saw</div>
      <div class='line'>In his own Land, and where his Word was Law;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he, poor Mortal, was rejoicing then</div>
      <div class='line'>Among his laughing Maids and labouring Men.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“So the great King of Babylon was glad</div>
      <div class='line'>In his proud Heart, and in a Moment mad.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“For there the Squire beheld a dangerous Face,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>Alluring, lovely, but with Lack of Grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And not of Craft; for then the Squire, betray’d      <span class='linenum'>50&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>By lawless Love, his wild Behests obeyed.</div>
      <div class='line'>The artful Damsel could her Way discern,</div>
      <div class='line'>And had not much of this bad World to learn</div>
      <div class='line'>Or its Deceits, but made her Will her Way;      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Could look as pure as on her Wedding-day      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The Maiden-Bride, and be in Heart as gay.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Then, as a simple Child, whene’er he spoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>She laughed, delighted at his Honour’s Joke;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus the Frailty in his Heart began—</div>
      <div class='line'>Frailty the same that bound the wisest man;      <span class='linenum'>60&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And far into that foul Reproach was gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Although our Squire was not a Solomon.</div>
      <div class='line'>I knew the Damsel; she was not a Ruth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And had been wild and wanton all her Youth.</div>
      <div class='line'>She from her Bible no Instruction took,</div>
      <div class='line'>But studied like a Dalilah to look;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till Grace forsook her, left to the Controul</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Evil Things that War against the Soul.—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“But I am wandering. When a Man is old,</div>
      <div class='line'>His Words come slowly, for his Blood is cold;      <span class='linenum'>70&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And, the less time he has his Tale to tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>The longer he on every part will dwell.</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! I’m like an old and crippled Steed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Slow but not sure—yet now I will proceed.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“The tempted Man was Mad and deaf and blind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sold his Peace to make an Harlot kind.</div>
      <div class='line'>He bought what he called Virtue at a Price</div>
      <div class='line'>She dared not ask, and then he found it Vice.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her purchased Smiles were as the changeful Ray</div>
      <div class='line'>Of April Suns—a Glimmer, and away!      <span class='linenum'>80&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“He who loved Gold, and all that Gold could win,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave all a Costly Sacrifice to Sin;</div>
      <div class='line'>Wife, Friends and his good Name were but as Dust</div>
      <div class='line'>In his Mind’s Ballance, that was now unjust.</div>
      <div class='line'>His Lady wept, but was no longer dear;</div>
      <div class='line'>His Friends admonished, Friends he would not hear;</div>
      <div class='line'>His Preacher threaten’d, he despised the Threat;</div>
      <div class='line'>Told of his Sin, he grew more sinful yet.</div>
      <div class='line'>Warnings were sent, at first the slight and slow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then more Awakening; and then came the Blow.      <span class='linenum'>90&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Fever and Pain confined him to his Bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Hope smiled faintly; but she quickly fled.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lost and bewildered, he repeats the Name</div>
      <div class='line'>That none can hear without Disgust or Shame.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Bring her,’ he cried, ‘and place her on a Throne;</div>
      <div class='line'>For she is worthy, and shall reign alone!’</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! his Queen was, like himself, attacked</div>
      <div class='line'>By that same Fever and with Terror racked;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now a Message to the Vicar sent,</div>
      <div class='line'>[Told that] his dying Honour would repent.      <span class='linenum'>100&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>“The Vicar came [at once, with] Christian speed;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>The Doctor bade him, if he dared, proceed;</div>
      <div class='line'>For he was watching how his drugs would back</div>
      <div class='line'>The struggling Nature in this strong Attack:</div>
      <div class='line'>Such Thoughts at best would Nature’s force impair</div>
      <div class='line'>And stop his Progress; ’twas not fighting fair.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘If I succeed, there’s nothing more to do;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if I fail, you’ll have a Day or two;</div>
      <div class='line'>When Hope is over, and a Man prepares</div>
      <div class='line'>Body and Soul to settle his Affairs.’      <span class='linenum'>110&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The Doctor fought, no doubt, with all his Might,</div>
      <div class='line'>But Nature yielded in the Doctor’s Spite;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the good Vicar had his leave to try</div>
      <div class='line'>All he could offer; for the Man must die.</div>
      <div class='line'>But there was no repose; the troubled Brain</div>
      <div class='line'>Could little bear and nothing could retain.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“In the same Night his troubled Spirit past</div>
      <div class='line'>That object of his Frailty breathed her last.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her we have buried in an earlier Day,</div>
      <div class='line'>And laid her where our parish poor we lay;      <span class='linenum'>120&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It took not long that Business to adjust—</div>
      <div class='line'>When common Folk are carried Dust to Dust.</div>
      <div class='line'>A few kind Neighbours, by the setting Sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bear the light Burden when their Work is done,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there’s an End.—But, when the Wealthy sleep,</div>
      <div class='line'>We keep the Body long as we can keep,</div>
      <div class='line'>And seek for help of those who will contrive</div>
      <div class='line'>To make things seem as all were yet alive.</div>
      <div class='line'>He lies in state, his Visits duly paid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And is—or he appears to be—obeyed.      <span class='linenum'>130&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>An intermediate State, when stopt the Breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>We make a kind of Compromise with Death:</div>
      <div class='line'>His is the Body, that he needs must have;</div>
      <div class='line'>But all is Life on this side of the Grave—</div>
      <div class='line'>As if alive, with Care we tend his Bed</div>
      <div class='line'>And bear him off, as if he felt us tread.</div>
      <div class='line'>With sad slow Pomp the Crowd behold him come      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And laid discreetly in his vaulted Home,      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>O’er which, his Worth inscribed, shall rise the stately Tomb.      <span class='linenum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Thus, when a Town has yielded, ’tis agreed—      <span class='linenum'>140&ensp;</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So have I heard—some Favour shall succeed;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, though the conquered Army must obey</div>
      <div class='line'>The Conqueror’s Will and sadly walk away,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet ’tis allowed to valiant Men and stout</div>
      <div class='line'>With War’s proud Honours to march proudly out.”</div>

      <div class='line'>Now for my Friend! ’Tis thirty years at least</div>
      <div class='line'>Since he began adventuring in the East;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, after labouring much with much Success,</div>
      <div class='line'>He now is worth—but think a bit and guess!</div>
      <div class='line'>He married early, but his Wife was weak;</div>
      <div class='line'>And his Boys died before they learn’d to speak.      <span class='linenum'>20&ensp;</span></div>

      <div class='line'>I left an elder Brother, only one</div>

      <div class='line'>Married a Dame with Money, and began,</div>

      <div class='line'>She left one Boy—and never Boy betrayed</div>
      <div class='line'>Less Wit than Ben; who married with his Maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>A close young Shrew—yet, do her right, she kept</div>
      <div class='line'>Together closely all that could be swept</div>
      <div class='line'>From his half-wasted Substance. Children more</div>

      <div class='line'>And felt that Glory new of all the Scene.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, as the Tidings of that Glory rose,</div>

      <div class='line'>Replete with troubles, comforts, hopes, and fears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bold expectations, efforts wild and strong,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou shalt find thy fond conjectures wrong.</div>
      <div class='line'>Imagination rules thee: thine are dreams,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every thing to thee is what it seems:</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou seest the surfaces of things, that pass</div>
      <div class='line'>Before thee, colour’d by thy fancy’s glass.</div>
      <div class='line'>The fact below is hidden! What is true</div>
      <div class='line'>In that fair mansion comes not in thy view;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou would’st feel a new and strange surprise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Should all within upon thy mind arise.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou think’st the lords of all these glorious things</div>
      <div class='line'>Are blest supremely! so they are—like kings!</div>
      <div class='line'>Envy them not their lofty state, my boy;</div>
      <div class='line'>They but possess the things that you enjoy.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Nay, but they’re lords of all you see around—</div>
      <div class='line'>Ring but a bell, and men obey the sound;</div>
      <div class='line'>Make but a motion, with the hand or eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>And their attendants at the signal fly.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>True, my fair lad! but this is contract all,</div>
      <div class='line'>For James is paid to heed his Honour’s call.</div>
      <div class='line'>Let wages cease, and lay the livery by,</div>
      <div class='line'>And James will heed no more than you or I.</div>
      <div class='line'>Service has lawful bound, and that beyond</div>
      <div class='line'>Is no obedience—’tis not in the bond.</div>
      <div class='line'>Footman, or groom, or butler, still he knows,</div>
      <div class='line'>So does his lord, the duty that he owes.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Labourers, you say, are grieved with daily toil—</div>
      <div class='line'>True—but the sweater goes not with the soil;</div>
      <div class='line'>He can change places, change his way of life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Take new employments—nay, can take a wife;</div>
      <div class='line'>If he offend, he knows the law’s decree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor can his judge in his accuser see;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, more than all the rest—or young or old,</div>
      <div class='line'>Useful or useless, he cannot be sold:</div>
      <div class='line'>Sorrow and want may in his cot be found,</div>
      <div class='line'>But not a Slave can live on British ground.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nor have the lords of all this wealth you see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their perfect freedom; few are truly free;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>Who rank the highest find the check of fate,</div>

      <div class='line'>Titles that, scarcely known, upon thy tongue</div>
      <div class='line'>With tremulous and erring accent hung—</div>
      <div class='line'>Now, when accustomed to the splendid Place</div>
      <div class='line'>And known to all of that illustrious Race;</div>
      <div class='line'>His Senses all, and most of all his Sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Indulged with all that can a Sense delight;</div>
      <div class='line'>His partial Friends, to humble Merits kind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to his Failings heedless if not blind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Bound to no Duty but a wish to please,</div>
      <div class='line'>And living like a Beggar at his ease—</div>
      <div class='line'>Now do these Scenes delight him, doth he gaze</div>
      <div class='line'>On objects that enchant him and amaze</div>
      <div class='line'>In mute Surprise? oh, no! the Time is past;</div>
      <div class='line'>Raptures and Wonders are not formed to last.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pensive, alone, he walks the Rooms around</div>
      <div class='line'>And seeks for Pleasure; but it is not found.</div>
      <div class='line'>All he can see he many times has seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And round and round the Maze of Pleasure been.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Pictures, now familiar to the Eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>He owns their beauty, but he passes by;</div>
      <div class='line'>These stately Rooms—that Park so fenced about,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where he was free, now shut his Freedom out,</div>
      <div class='line'>And keeps, he feels—yet fears it as a Sin,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he ungrateful—Lassitude within.</div>
      <div class='line'>Himself discerning, he has learned to trace</div>
      <div class='line'>The Signs of Languor in the loveliest face.</div>
      <div class='line'>The great, the wealthy, who cannot enjoy</div>
      <div class='line'>What Time brings forth, would Time himself destroy;</div>
      <div class='line'>But that a Lad from life laborious freed</div>
      <div class='line'>Should sigh for Action, this is strange indeed;</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet no Labours in the years gone by</div>
      <div class='line'>Cost him the feeling witnessed in that Sigh.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Lo! now they meet and greeting seem to say,</div>
      <div class='line'>“How dealt you, Friends, with Father Time to-day?”</div>
      <div class='line'>When each his warfare has with Time confest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then all acknowledge they are yet opprest.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Our Youth has wandered in his Way and sees</div>
      <div class='line'>The Village tribe, as he conceives, at ease;</div>
      <div class='line'>All seeming well their Lot in Life to bear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because they know not his peculiar Care.</div>

      <div class='line'>All this our Youth beheld, and, with a sigh</div>
      <div class='line'>Reflected, “Not a care in Life have I.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then why not seek it? Ask the man who dines</div>
      <div class='line'>Daily on costly food and generous Wines,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who feels no Pain, who no Complaint can make,</div>
      <div class='line'>But only feels he can no Pleasure take—</div>
      <div class='line'>And he will answer, that ’tis Fortune’s Will;</div>
      <div class='line'>He may be weary, but he must be still.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oh! had they told thee, when thou sat’st with pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>And grateful joy, at Madam Johnson’s side,</div>
      <div class='line'>And heard the lisping Flora, blue-eyed maid,</div>

      <div class='line'>With leave to wander as thou would’st, to read</div>

      <div class='line'>Thy reach, it seem’d to thee a crime to love,</div>

      <div class='line'>How near approach the lofty and the low!</div>
      <div class='line'>In all we dare, and all we dare not name,</div>
      <div class='line'>How much the great and little are the same!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Well, thou hast tried it—thou hast closely seen</div>
      <div class='line'>What greatness has without it, and within;</div>
      <div class='line'>Where now the joyful expectation?—fled!</div>
      <div class='line'>The strong anticipating spirit?—dead!</div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
